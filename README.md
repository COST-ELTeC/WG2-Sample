# WG2-Sample

Repository, initially for the use of WG2 in preparing their white paper on "Annotating European Novels for Distant Reading".

It should contain a total of 100 samples from each of at least 7 different ELTeC repositories, made up of 5 random passages of 400 whitespace-delimited tokens taken from each of 20 novels. Headings should be excluded, but not poetry and each sample should be a well formed XML fragment.
