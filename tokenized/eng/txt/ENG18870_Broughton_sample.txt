"
Do
you
think
she
came
on
purpose
,
then
?
"
asks
Essie
,
her
eyes
opening
as
round
in
alarmed
surprise
as
a
baby
's
when
a
grown
-
up
person
makes
ugly
faces
at
it
.


He
shrugs
his
shoulders
slightly
.

"
Can
not
say
,
I
'm
sure
.

Conny
is
not
much
in
the
habit
of
burning
the
midnight
oil
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
generally
.

If
it
was
accident
,
she
came
in
at
a
wonderfully
à
propos
,
or
rather
mal
à
propos
,
moment
.

Tell
me
,
"
he
says
,
crossing
over
to
her
side
of
the
road
,
and
fixing
frankly
-
asking
eyes
upon
her
;
"
I
may
be
mistake
n
—
it
is
a
misfortune
to
which
I
am
often
incident
—
but
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
,
just
as
that
unlucky
candle
appeared
round
the
corner
last
night
,
you
were
going
to
tell
me
something
—
something
about
yourself
?

I
thought
I
saw
it
in
your
face
.

I
think
I
deserved
some
little
reward
for
raking
up
for
your
behoof
the
ashes
of
that
old
fire
that
I
bur
nt
my
fingers
at
so
badly
once
.
"


Esther
still
remains
silent
,
but
turns
her
long
neck
from
one
side
to
the
other
with
a
restless
,
uneasy
motion
.


"
Are
lamplight
and
the
small
hours
indispensable
accessories
"
he
asks
,
with
gentle
pleading
in
look
and
words
—"
or
could
not
you
tell
me
as
well
now
?
"


"
Tell
you
what
"
she
says
,
turning
round
sharp
upon
him
,
and
snapping
,
as
a
little
cross
dog
snaps
at
the
heels
of
the
passer
-
by
—
"
must
I
invent
something
?
"


"
Are
you
sure
that
it
is
necessary
to
invent
?
"

he
asks
,
scanning
the
fair
,
troubled
face
with
searching
gaze
.


She
pulls
a
bunch
of
nuts
out
of
the
hedge
from
among
their
rough
-
ribbed
green
leaves
,
and
begins
to
pick
them
out
of
their
sheath
.

"
What
am
I
to
tell
you
?
"
she
says
,
petulantly
,
a
suspicion
that
he
may
have
heard
a
rumour
of
her
engagement
crossing
her
mind
:
"
that
I
live
in
an
old
farm
-
house
with
my
brother
Jack
,
and
that
we
are
very
hard
up
—
you
know
already
;
that
'
Sudrydachi
'
is
Welsh
for
'
How
do
you
do
'
and
that
our
asparagus
has
answered
very
badly
this
year
?
"


"
Of
course
,
I
can
not
force
your
confidence
,
"
he
answers
,
rather
coldly
.


"
Why
do
you
insist
upon
my
having
something
to
confide
?

What
reason
have
you
for
supposing
that
I
have
?
"
she
cries
,
with
increased
irritation
.


"
None
whatever
,
but
what
you
yourself
have
given
me
!
"


"
I
!
"


"
Yes
,
you
;
not
your
words
,
but
your
face
now
and
then
.

Do
n't
think
me
impertinent
.

You
know
what
unhappy
reason
I
have
had
to
be
suspicious
.

But
tell
me
"
(
trying
his
best
to
get
a
look
round
the
corner
into
the
averted
,
perturbed
face
of
his
companion
)
—"
tell
me
whether
there
is
not
something
between
you
and
—
and
—
that
fellow
that
gave
you
the
prayer
-
book
?
"


"
I
can
not
!

—I
can
not
!
"
she
cries
,
vehemently
;
"
do
n't
ask
me
!

Why
did
n't
I
die
?

When
they
saw
I
was
getting
well
,
they
ought
to
have
killed
me
.

Oh
,
I
wish
they
had
!
"


"
I
'm
rather
glad
,
on
the
whole
,
they
did
not
,
"
he
answers
,
gravely
;
and
so
,
with
one
final
effort
,
he
being
strong
,
and
she
being
weak
,
he
obtains
possession
of
her
two
hands
,
and
her
face
lies
bare
,
unshaded
—
dyed
with
an
agony
of
shame
—
clothed
with
great
beauty
—
under
the
hungry
tenderness
of
his
happy
eyes
.


"
To
think
of
making
one
's
last
dying
speech
and
confession
,
and
then
not
dying
after
all
,
"
she
says
,
in
torments
of
confusion
,
yet
unable
to
restrain
an
uneasy
laugh
.

"
It
is
too
disgraceful
!

I
shall
never
get
over
it
!

Never
!—NEVER
!
—

NEVER
!!
"


"
Time
,
which
mitigates
all
afflictions
,
may
mitigate
yours
,
"
he
replies
,
gaily
,
unable
to
resist
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
teasing
her
.


She
turns
from
him
with
a
petulant
movement
of
head
and
shoulder
.

"
Why
do
n't
you
go
?
"

she
cries
,
the
angry
tears
flashing
into
her
eyes
;
"
I
hate
the
sight
of
you
!
"


At
that
he
grows
grave
.

"
Essie
,
"
he
says
,
slipping
his
arms
round
her
as
she
sits
,
shrinking
away
from
him
in
the
deep
chintz
chair
,
"
in
that
awful
moment
,
when
you
thought
—
and
God
knows
I
thought
so
too
—
that
we
were
saying
'
goodbye
'
to
one
another
for
always
,
the
barriers
that
your
wretched
false
pride
had
built
up
between
us
were
knocked
down
;
try
as
you
may
,
you
can
never
build
them
up
again
.
"


"
I
knocked
down
plenty
of
barriers
,
I
'm
aware
,
"
she
answers
,
ruefully
.

"
You
need
not
remind
me
of
that
!
"


"
Never
to
be
built
up
again
any
more
—
never
any
more
!
"

he
says
,
his
mirth
swallowed
up
in
great
solemn
joy
.


She
has
fallen
forwards
into
his
embrace
;
he
holds
her
little
trembling
form
against
his
heart
—a
posture
to
which
she
submits
,
chiefly
because
it
affords
her
an
opportunity
of
hiding
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
.


"
Never
any
more
!
"
she
repeats
,
mechanically
,
and
then
there
is
silence
,
save
for
the
thrush
,
that
trills
ever
his
high
tender
lay
.

Presently
Essie
stirs
,
and
whispers
,
with
uneasiness
,
"
St
.
John
!
"


"
Well
?
"


"
You
wo
n't
tell
any
one
,
will
you
?
"


"
Tell
them
what
?

—
that
you
and
I
are
going
to
be
married
?

By
this
time
to
-
morrow
I
hope
to
have
told
every
one
I
meet
:

I
am
not
so
selfish
as
to
wish
to
keep
such
good
news
to
myself
.
"


"
Peculiar
!
"
repeats

Esther
,
rather
resentfully
,
raising
her
great
eyes
in
unfeigned
,
displeased
surprise
to
her
companion
's
face
.

"
Am
I
so
very
odd
-
looking
,
Mrs.
Brandon
?

I
do
n't
think
I
can
be
,
for
no
one
ever
told
me
so
before
!
"


"
I
did
not
say
odd
-
looking
,
my
dear
,
"
returns
Mrs.
Brandon
,
sharply
;
"
please
do
n't
put
words
into
my
mouth
.
"


"
If
people
came
to
buy
cloaks
,
they
would
surely
be
thinking
of
how
they
were
looking
,
not
how
I
looked
,
"
says
Esther
,
not
yet
quite
recovered
from
her
annoyed
astonishment
;
"
my
appearance
,
beyond
the
mere
fact
of
my
being
tall
,
could
not
be
of
much
consequence
one
way
or
another
.
"


Mrs.
Brandon
takes
off
and
lays
down
her
spectacles
the
better
to
point
the
rebuke
she
is
about
to
administer
.


"

Esther
,
"
she
says
,
severely
,
"
since
you
insist
on
my
explaining
myself
more
clearly
,
I
must
tell
you
that
I
think
a
girl
should
be
steadier
in
conduct
,
and
more
decidedly
imbued
with
religious
principles
than
I
have
any
reason
for
supposing
you
to
be
,
before
she
is
exposed
to
the
temptations
to
which
a
young
and
handsome
woman
is
liable
in
one
of
those
sinks
of
iniquity
,
our
great
towns
.
"


Esther
flings
up
her
head
with
an
angry
gesture
.

"
I
really
do
n't
see
what
temptations
a
person
even
as
unsteady
and
irreligious
as
I
am
,
"
she
says
,
contemptuously
,
"
could
be
exposed
to
in
a
haberdasher
's
shop
.

Temptation
,
in
a
woman
's
mouth
,
always
implies
something
about
men
;
and
in
a
place
specially
devoted
to
woman
's
dress
,
one
would
be
less
likely
to
see
them
than
in
any
other
spot
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
"


"
If
you
are
so
much
better
informed
on
the
subject
than
a
person
of
treble
your
years
and
experience
,
"
says
Mrs.
Brandon
,
resuming
her
spectacles
,
and
beginning
to
knit
faster
than
ever
,
"
I
have
,
of
course
,
no
more
to
say
.
"


An
apposite
retort
rises
prompt
and
saucy
to
Esther
's
lips
,
clamouring
for
egress
through
those
sweet
red
gates
;
but
the
recollection
of
Mrs.
Brandon
's
weak
tea
and
legs
of
mutton
,
and
the
obligations
thereto
hanging
,
drives
it
back
again
.

She
leans
her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
and
elevates
her
straight
dark
brows
.


"
The
question
is
,
"
she
says
,
gravely
,
"
can
you
suggest
anything
better
?

When
one
has
no
money
,
and
none
of
the
acquirements
that
command
money
,
one
must
take
what
one
can
get
,
and
be
thankful
.
"


But
Mrs.
Brandon
is
silent
,
counting
her
stitches
,
buried
in
calculations
as
to
whether
her
stocking
-
leg
has
attained
the
length
and
breadth
suited
to
the
dimensions
of
one
of
her
son
's
large
limbs
.


"

No
.
"


"
You
are
certain
?
"


"
Certain
.

Whatever
you
do
,
I
shall
love
you
to
-
day
,
and
to
-
morrow
,
and
always
,
"
says
the
young
fellow
,
very
solemnly
;
and
his
eyes
go
away
past
her
,
through
the
window
,
and
up
to
the
blue
sky
overhead
,
as
if
calling
on
the
great
pale
vault
to
be
witness
between
him
and
her
.


As
for
her
,
her
prosaic
soul
has
wandered
back
to
the
mutton
;
she
takes
the
opportunity
of
his
eyes
being
averted
to
steal
a
glance
at
the
clock
.

Apparently
,
however
,
he
has
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
,
for
he
says
hastily
,
with
rather
a
pained
smile
:
"
You
are
longing
for
me
to
go
.
"


"
No—o
.
"


"
I
ought
not
to
have
come
at
this
time
of
night
.

I
ought
to
have
waited
till
to
-
morrow
,
I
know
.
"


"
It
is
rather
late
.
"


"
But
to
-
morrow
seemed
such
a
long
time
off
,
that
I
thought
I
must
know
the
worst
or
the
best
before
the
sun
came
up
again
.

I
do
n't
quite
know
which
it
is
now
;
which
is
it
,
Esther
?
"


"
It
's
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
;
it
's
the
second
best
,
"
she
answers
,
all
smiles
again
at
seeing
some
prospect
of
her
admirer
's
departure
,
and
forgetting
,
with
youthful
heedlessness
,
the
price
at
which
that
departure
has
been
bought
.

"
It
is
that
I
really
am
very
much
obliged
,
though
,
all
the
same
I
wish
you
would
think
better
of
it
,
and
that
I
'll
try
;
I
will
,
really
;
do
n't
look
as
if
you
did
not
believe
me
.
"


So
with
this
half
-
loaf
he
goes
,
passes
away
through
the
little
wooden
porch
,
that
is
so
low
it
looks
as
if
it
were
going
to
knock
his
tall
head
,
past
the
stables
,
and
through
the
oak
woods
,
home


As
saith
that
most
delicious
of
love
poems
that
makes
us
all
feel
immoral
as
we
read
it
.

It
is
the
hour
when
chanticleer
retires
to
his
perch
in
the
henhouse
,
lowers
his
proud
tail
,
sinks
his
neck
into
his
breast
,
and
goes
to
sleep
between
his
two
fattest
wives
.

It
is
the
hour
when
animal
life
and
wild
humanity
retire
to
bed
;
the
hour
when
tamed
humanity
sits
down
to
dinner
.

The
more
we
advance
in
civilisation
the
farther
back
we
push
the
boundaries
of
sleep
and
forgetfulness
.

When
we
reach
our
highest
point
of
culture
,
I
suppose
we
shall
hustle
the
blessed
,
the
divine
Nepenthe
,
off
the
face
of
the
earth
altogether
.


"
I
beg
your
pardon
;
this
machine
makes
such
a
noise
that
I
did
not
catch
what
you
said
.
"


"
I
was
only
wishing
that
mother
could
see
you
now
.
"


"
It
is
a
pleasure
she
enjoys
pretty
frequently
.

Why
now
particularly
?
"


"
She
would
see
how
thrifty
and
housewifely
you
can
be
.
"


"
I
am
glad
she
does
not
,
then
,
"
answers
the
girl
,
drily
,
beginning
to
work
again
faster
than
ever
,
and
flushing
with
annoyance
;
"
she
would
form
a
most
erroneous
estimate
of
me
.

I
dislike
particularly
to
be
found
by
people
in
one
of
my
rare
paroxysms
of
virtue
;
they
take
it
for
my
normal
state
,
and
judge
and
expect
of
me
accordingly
.
"


"
I
shall
tell
her
that
,
at
all
events
,
my
judgment
of
you
was
nearer
the
truth
than
hers
,
"
says
Robert
,
triumphantly
.


Esther
laughs
awkwardly
.


"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
aware
of
it
,
but
you
are
conveying
to
my
mind
the
idea
that
your
mother
has
been
pronouncing
a
very
unfavourable
verdict
upon
me
and
my
character
.
"


"
She
thinks
you
are
too
pretty
and
lively
,
and
—
and
—
"
(
frivolous
had
been
the
word
employed
by
Mrs.
Brandon
,
but
Robert
can
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
apply
it
to
his
idol
)
—
"
too
fond
of
society
to
care
about
being
useful
in
tame
,
humdrum
,
every
day
ways
.
"


Esther
gives
her
head
a
little
impatient
shake
.


"
Mrs.
Brandon
adheres
to
the
golden
axiom
,
so
evidently
composed
by
some
one
to
whom
beauty
was
sour
grapes
,
that
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
pretty
;
an
axiom
that
assumes
that
the
one
is
incompatible
with
the
other
.
"


So
speaking
she
relapses
into
a
chafed
silence
,
and
he
into
his
vigilant
dumb
observation
of
her
.

At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
as
he
still
shows
no
signs
of
moving
,
finding
the
present
position
of
affairs
no
longer
tolerable
,
Miss
Craven
jumps
up
,
flings
down
her
heap
of
huckaback
on
the
floor
,
and
says
abruptly
,
with
a
sort
of
forced
resignation
:


"
I
will
come
to
the
wood
,
if
you
wish
;
it
will
be
all
the
same
a
hundred
years
hence
.
"


"
I
am
perfectly
happy
as
I
am
,
"
he
answers
with
provoking
good
humour
,
looking
up
in
blissful
unconsciousness
at
her
charming
cross
face
,
and
the
plain
yet
dainty
fit
of
her
trim
cheap
gown
.


"
But
I
am
not
,
"
she
rejoins
brusquely
;
"
indoors
it
is
stifling
to
-
day
;
please
introduce
me
as
quickly
as
possible
to
that
breeze
you
spoke
of
;
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
trace
of
one
all
day
.
"
