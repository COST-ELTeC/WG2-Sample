“
How
foolish
!
”

Whether
this
applied
to
the
endeavour
or
to
the
remark
,
did
not
quite
appear
.

Lady
Engleton
's
graceful
figure
leant
over
the
parapet
.


“
Do
you
know
,
Mrs.
Temperley
,
”
she
said
in
her
incessantly
vivacious
manner
,
“
I
have
scarcely
heard
a
serious
word
since
our
two
Professors
came
to
us
.

Is
n't
it
disgraceful
?

I
naturally
expected
to
be
improved
and
enlightened
,
but
they
are
both
so
frivolous
,
I
ca
n't
keep
them
for
a
moment
to
any
important
subject
.

They
refuse
to
be
profound
.

It
is
I
who
have
to
be
profound
.
”


“
While
we
endeavour
to
be
charming
,
”
said
Professor
Theobald
.


“
You
may
think
that
flattering
,
but
I
confess
it
seems
to
me
a
beggarly
compliment
(
as
men
's
to
women
usually
are
)
.
”


“
You
expect
too
much
of
finite
intelligence
,
Lady
Engleton
.
”


“
This
is
how
I
am
always
put
off
!

If
it
were
not
that
you
are
both
such
old
friends
—
you
are
a
sort
of
cousin
I
think
,
Professor
Fortescue
—I
should
really
feel
aggrieved
.

One
has
to
endure
so
much
more
from
relations
.

No
,
but
really
;
I
appeal
to
Mrs.
Temperley
.

When
one
is
hungering
for
erudition
,
to
be
offered
compliments
!

Not
that
I
can
accuse
Professor
Fortescue
of
compliments
,
”
she
added
with
a
laugh
;
“
wild
horses
would
not
drag
one
from
him
.

I
angle
vainly
.

But
he
is
so
ridiculously
young
.

He
enjoys
things
as
if
he
were
a
schoolboy
.

Does
one
look
for
that
in
one
's
Professors
?

He
talks
of
the
country
as
if
it
were
Paradise
Regained
.
”


“
So
it
is
to
me
,
”
he
said
with
a
smile
.


“
But
that
is
not
your
rôle
.

You
have
to
think
,
not
to
enjoy
.
”


“
Then
you
must
not
invite
us
to
Craddock
Place
,
”
Professor
Theobald
stipulated
.


“
As
usual
,
a
halting
compliment
.
”


“
To
take
you
seriously
,
Lady
Engleton
,
”
said
Professor
Fortescue
,
“
(
though
I
know
it
is
a
dangerous
practice
)
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
an
occasional
think
is
to
enable
one
to
relish
the
joys
of
mental
vacuity
,
just
as
the
pleasure
of
idleness
is
never
fully
known
till
one
has
worked
.
”


“
Ah
,
”
sighed
Lady
Engleton
,
“
I
know
I
do
n't
extract
the
full
flavour
out
of
that
!
”


“
It
is
a
neglected
art
,
”
said
the
Professor
.

“
After
worrying
himself
with
the
problems
of
existence
,
as
the
human
being
is
prone
to
do
,
as
soon
as
existence
is
more
or
less
secure
and
peaceful
,
a
man
can
experience
few
things
more
enjoyable
than
to
leave
aside
all
problems
and
go
out
into
the
fields
,
into
the
sun
,
to
feel
the
life
in
his
veins
,
the
world
at
the
threshold
of
his
five
senses
.
”


Hubert
sank
back
in
his
chair
,
and
ran
his
hand
over
his
brow
.

He
seemed
about
to
speak
,
but
he
checked
himself
.


“
Where
did
you
get
such
extraordinary
ideas
from
?
”
cried

Miss
Temperley
.


“
They
were
like
Topsy
;
they
growed
,
”
said
Fred
.


“
We
have
been
in
the
habit
of
speculating
freely
on
all
subjects
,
”
said
Ernest
,
“
ever
since
we
could
talk
.

This
is
the
blessed
result
!
”


“
I
am
not
quite
so
sure
now
,
that
the
Preposterous
Society
meets
with
my
approval
,
”
observed
Miss
Temperley
.


“
If
you
had
been
brought
up
in
the
bosom
of
this
Society
,
Miss
Temperley
,
you
too
,
perhaps
,
would
have
come
to
this
.

Think
of
it
!
”


“
Does
your
mother
know
what
sort
of
subjects
you
discuss
?
”


There
was
a
shout
of
laughter
.

“
Mother
used
often
to
come
into
the
nursery
and
surprise
us
in
hot
discussion
on
the
origin
of
evil
,
”
said
Hadria
.


“
Do
n't
you
believe
what
she
says
,
Miss
Temperley
,
”
cried
Fred
;
“
mother
never
could
teach
Hadria
the
most
rudimentary
notions
of
accuracy
.
”


“
Her
failure
with
my
brothers
,
was
in
the
department
of
manners
,
”
Hadria
observed
.


“
Then
she
does
not
know
what
you
talk
about
?
”
persisted
Henriette
.


“
You
ask
her
,
”
prompted
Fred
,
with
undisguised
glee
.


“
She
never
attends
our
meetings
,
”
said
Algitha
.


“
Well
,
well
,
I
can
not
understand
it
!
”
cried

Miss
Temperley
.

“
However
,
you
do
n't
quite
know
what
you
are
talking
about
,
and
one
must
n't
blame
you
.
”


“
No
,
do
n't
,
”
urged
Fred
;
“
we
are
a
sensitive
family
.
”


“
Shut
up
!
”
cried

Ernest
with
a
warning
frown
.


“
Oh
,
you
are
a
coarse
-
grained
exception
;
I
speak
of
the
family
average
,
”
Fred
answered
with
serenity
.


Henriette
felt
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
with
this
strange
audience
.

Her
business
was
really
with
the
President
of
the
Society
.

The
girl
was
bent
on
ruining
her
life
with
these
wild
notions
.

Miss
Temperley
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
talk
to
Hadria
quietly
in
her
own
room
,
away
from
the
influence
of
these
eccentric
brothers
and
that
extraordinary
sister
.

After
all
,
it
was
Algitha
who
had
originated
the
shocking
view
,
not
Hadria
,
who
had
merely
agreed
,
doubtless
out
of
a
desire
to
support
her
sister
.


“
I
have
not
known
you
for
seven
years
,
but
I
am
going
to
poke
your
fire
,
”
said
Henriette
,
when
they
were
established
in
Hadria
's
room
.


“
I
never
thought
you
would
wait
so
long
as
that
,
”
was
Hadria
's
ambiguous
reply
.


Then
Henriette
opened
her
batteries
.

She
talked
without
interruption
,
her
companion
listening
,
agreeing
occasionally
with
her
adversary
,
in
a
disconcerting
manner
;
then
falling
into
silence
.


Mrs.
Temperley
asked
for
the
address
of
the
aunt
.


“
I
suppose
no
one
knows
who
the
father
is
?

He
has
not
acknowledged
the
child
!
”


No
;
that
was
a
mystery
still
.


About
a
week
later
,
Craddock
Dene
was
amazed
by
the
news
that
Mrs.
Temperley
had
taken
the
child
of
Ellen
Jervis
under
her
protection
.

A
cottage
had
been
secured
on
the
road
to
Craddock
,
a
trustworthy
nurse
engaged
,
and
here
the
babe
was
established
,
with
the
consent
and
blessing
of
the
aunt
.


“
You
are
the
most
inconsistent
woman
I
ever
met
!
”
exclaimed
Miss
Du
Prel
.


“
Why
inconsistent
?
”


“
You
say
that
children
have
been
the
means
,
from
time
immemorial
,
of
enslaving
women
,
and
here
you
go
and
adopt
one
of
your
enslavers
!
”


“
But
this
child
is
not
legitimate
.
”


Valeria
stared
.


“
Whatever
the
wrongs
of
Ellen
Jervis
,
at
least
there
were
no
laws
written
,
and
unwritten
,
which
demanded
of
her
as
a
duty
that
she
should
become
the
mother
of
this
child
.

In
that
respect
she
escapes
the
ignominy
reserved
for
the
married
mother
who
produces
children
that
are
not
even
hers
.
”


“
You
do
manage
to
ferret
out
the
unpleasant
aspects
of
our
position
!
”

Miss
Du
Prel
exclaimed
.

“
But
I
want
to
know
why
you
do
this
,
Hadria
.

It
is
good
of
you
,
but
totally
unlike
you
.
”


“
You
are
very
polite
!
”
cried
Hadria
.

“
Why
should
I
not
lay
up
store
for
myself
in
heaven
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Walker
and
the
rest
?
”


“
You
were
not
thinking
of
heaven
when
you
did
this
deed
,
Hadria
.
”


“
No
;
I
was
thinking
of
the
other
place
.
”


“
And
do
you
hope
to
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
your
protégée
?
”


Hadria
shrugged
her
shoulders
.


“
I
do
n't
know
.

The
child
is
the
result
of
great
sorrow
and
suffering
;
it
is
the
price
of
a
woman
's
life
;
a
woman
who
offended
the
world
,
having
lived
for
nearly
forty
weary
obedient
years
,
in
circumstances
dreary
enough
to
have
turned
twenty
saints
into
as
many
sinners
.

No
;
I
am
no
Lady
Bountiful
.

I
feel
in
defending
this
child
—a
sorry
defence
I
know
—
that
I
am
,
in
so
far
,
opposing
the
world
and
the
system
of
things
that
I
hate
—
.

Ah
!

how
I
hate
it
!
”


“
Is
it
then
hatred
that
prompts
the
deed
?
”


Hadria
looked
thoughtfully
towards
the
church
tower
,
in
whose
shadow
the
mother
of
the
babe
lay
sleeping
.


“
Can
you
ever
quite
unravel
your
own
motives
,
Valeria
?

Hatred
?

Yes
;
there
is
a
large
ingredient
of
hatred
.

Without
it
,
probably
this
poor
infant
would
have
been
left
to
struggle
through
life
alone
,
with
a
mill
-
stone
round
its
neck
,
and
a
miserable
constitution
into
the
bargain
.

I
hope
to
rescue
its
constitution
.

But
that
poor
woman
's
story
touched
me
closely
.

It
is
so
hard
,
so
outrageous
!

The
emptiness
of
her
existence
;
the
lack
of
outlet
for
her
affections
;
the
endless
monotony
;
and
then
the
sudden
new
interest
and
food
for
the
starved
emotions
;
the
hero-worship
that
is
latent
in
us
all
;
and
then
—
good
heavens
!
—
for
a
touch
of
poetry
,
of
romance
in
her
life
,
she
would
have
been
ready
to
believe
in
the
professions
of
the
devil
himself
—
and
this
man
was
a
very
good
understudy
for
the
devil
!

Ah
!

If
ever
I
should
meet
him
!
”


Hadria
,
dropping
the
subject
,
enquired
whether
the
Professor
was
well
acquainted
with
this
part
of
the
country
.


He
knew
it
by
heart
.

A
charming
country
;
warm
,
luxuriant
,
picturesque
,
the
pick
of
England
to
his
mind
.

What
could
beat
its
woodlands
,
its
hills
,
its
relics
of
the
old
world
,
its
barns
and
churches
and
smiling
villages
?


“
Then
it
is
not
only
Tudor
mansions
that
attract
you
?
”

Hadria
could
not
resist
asking
.


Tudor
mansions
?

There
was
no
cottage
so
humble
,
provided
it
were
picturesque
,
that
did
not
charm
him
.


“
Really
!
”
exclaimed
Hadria
,
with
a
faintly
emphasized
surprise
.


“
Have
I
put
my
luckless
foot
into
it
again
?
”


“
May
I
not
be
impressed
by
magnanimity
?
”


The
Professor
's
mouth
shut
sharply
.


“
Mrs.
Temperley
is
pleased
to
deride
me
.

Craddock
Dene
must
shrivel
under
destroying
blasts
like
these
.
”


“
Not
so
much
as
one
might
think
.
”


The
sound
of
their
steps
on
the
broad
avenue
smote
sharply
on
their
ears
.

Their
absurd
-
looking
shadows
stretched
always
in
front
of
them
.

“
A
splendid
night
,
”
Hadria
observed
,
to
break
the
silence
.


“
Glorious
!
”

returned
her
companion
,
as
if
waking
from
thought
.


“
Spring
is
our
best
season
here
,
the
time
of
blossoming
.
”


“
I
am
horribly
tempted
to
take
root
in
the
lovely
district
,
in
the
hope
of
also
blossoming
.

Can
you
imagine
me
a
sort
of
patriarchal
apple
-
tree
laden
with
snowy
blooms
?
”


“
You
somewhat
burden
my
imagination
.
”


“
I
have
had
to
work
hard
all
my
life
,
until
an
unexpected
legacy
from
an
admirable
distant
relation
put
me
at
the
end
of
a
longer
tether
.

I
still
have
to
work
,
but
less
hard
.

I
have
always
tried
not
to
ossify
,
keeping
in
view
a
possible
serene
time
to
come
,
when
I
might
put
forth
blossoms
in
this
vernal
fashion
that
tempts
my
middle
-
aged
fancy
.

And
where
could
I
choose
a
sweeter
spot
for
these
late
efforts
to
be
young
and
green
,
than
here
in
this
perfect
south
of
England
home
?
”


“
It
seems
large
,
”
said
Hadria
.


Professor
Theobald
grinned
.

“
You
do
n't
appear
to
take
a
keen
interest
in
my
blossoming
.
”


Why
in
heaven
's
name
should
she
?


“
I
can
not
naturally
expect
it
,
”
Professor
Theobald
continued
,
reading
her
silence
aright
,
“
but
I
should
be
really
obliged
by
your
counsel
on
this
matter
.

You
know
the
village
;
you
know
from
your
own
experience
whether
it
is
a
place
to
live
in
always
.

Advise
me
,
I
beg
.
”


“
Really
,
Professor
Theobald
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
advise
you
in
a
matter
so
entirely
depending
on
your
own
taste
and
your
own
affairs
.
”


“
Really
,
Mrs.
Temperley
,
you
were
not
born
for
an
English
village
.

I
should
like
Mrs.
Walker
to
hear
you
!
”


“
Mrs
.
Walker
knows
better
than
to
listen
to
me
.

She
too
hides
somewhere
,
deep
down
,
a
poor
fettered
thing
that
would
gladly
join
the
revel
,
if
it
dared
.

We
all
do
.
”


Lady
Engleton
dwelt
joyously
on
the
image
of
Mrs.
Walker
,
cavorting
,
garlanded
,
on
a
Greek
slope
,
with
the
nymphs
and
water
-
sprites
for
familiar
company
.


Lady
Engleton
had
risen
laughing
,
and
proposed
a
stroll
to
Hadria
.


Henriette
,
who
did
not
like
the
tone
the
conversation
was
taking
,
desired
to
join
them
.


“
I
never
quite
know
how
far
you
are
serious
,
and
how
far
you
are
just
amusing
yourself
,
Hadria
,
”
said
Lady
Engleton
.

“
Our
talking
of
Greece
reminds
me
of
some
remark
you
made
the
other
day
,
about
Helen
.

You
seemed
to
me
almost
to
sympathize
with
her
.
”


Hadria
's
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
across
miles
of
sea
to
the
sunny
Grecian
land
.


“
If
a
slave
breaks
his
chains
and
runs
,
I
am
always
glad
,
”
she
said
.


“
I
was
talking
about
Helen
.
”


“
So
was
I
.

If
a
Spartan
wife
throws
off
her
bondage
and
defies
the
laws
that
insult
her
,
I
am
still
more
glad
.
”


“
But
not
if
she
sins
?
”

Henriette
coughed
,
warningly
.


“
Yes
;
if
she
sins
.
”


“
Oh
,
Hadria
,
”
remonstrated
Henriette
,
in
despair
.


“
I
do
n't
see
that
it
follows
that
Helen
did
sin
,
however
;
one
does
not
know
much
about
her
sentiments
.

She
revolted
against
the
tyranny
that
held
her
shut
in
,
enslaved
,
body
and
soul
,
in
that
wonderful
Greek
world
of
hers
.

I
am
charmed
to
think
that
she
gave
her
countrymen
so
much
trouble
to
assert
her
husband
's
right
of
ownership
.

It
was
at
his
door
that
the
siege
of
Troy
ought
to
be
laid
.

I
only
wish
elopements
always
caused
as
much
commotion
!
”

Lady
Engleton
laughed
,
and
Miss
Temperley
tried
to
catch
Hadria
's
eye
.


“
Well
,
that
is
a
strange
idea
!

And
do
you
really
think
Helen
did
not
sin
?

Seriously
now
.
”


“
I
do
n't
know
.

There
is
no
evidence
on
that
point
.
”

Lady
Engleton
laughed
again
.


“
You
do
amuse
me
.

Assuming
that
Helen
did
not
sin
,
I
suppose
you
would
(
if
only
for
the
sake
of
paradox
)
accuse
the
virtuous
Greek
matrons
—
who
sat
at
home
,
and
wove
,
and
span
,
and
bore
children
—
of
sinning
against
the
State
!
”


“
Certainly
,
”
said
Hadria
,
undismayed
.

“
It
was
they
who
insidiously
prepared
the
doom
for
their
country
,
as
they
wove
and
span
and
bore
children
,
with
stupid
docility
.

As
surely
as
an
enemy
might
undermine
the
foundations
of
a
city
till
it
fell
in
with
a
crash
,
so
surely
they
brought
ruin
upon
Greece
.
