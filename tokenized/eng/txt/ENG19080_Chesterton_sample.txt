The
men
in
the
motor
‑
car
looked
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
his
dreamy
gaze
,
and
they
saw
that
the
whole
regiment
at
the
end
of
the
road
was
advancing
upon
them
,
Dr.
Renard
marching
furiously
in
front
,
his
beard
flying
in
the
breeze
.


The
Colonel
sprang
out
of
the
car
with
an
intolerant
exclamation
.


“
Gentlemen
,
”
he
cried
,
“
the
thing
is
incredible
.

It
must
be
a
practical
joke
.

If
you
knew
Renard
as
I
do
—
it
’s
like
calling
Queen
Victoria
a
dynamiter
.

If
you
had
got
the
man
’s
character
into
your
head
—
”


“
Dr.
Bull
,
”
said
Syme
sardonically
,
“
has
at
least
got
it
into
his
hat
.
”


“
I
tell
you
it
ca
n’t
be
!
”
cried
the
Colonel
,
stamping
.


“
Renard
shall
explain
it
.

He
shall
explain
it
to
me
,
”
and
he
strode
forward
.


“
Do
n’t
be
in
such
a
hurry
,
”
drawled
the
smoker
.

“
He
will
very
soon
explain
it
to
all
of
us
.
”


But
the
impatient
Colonel
was
already
out
of
earshot
,
advancing
towards
the
advancing
enemy
.

The
excited
Dr.
Renard
lifted
his
pistol
again
,
but
perceiving
his
opponent
,
hesitated
,
and
the
Colonel
came
face
to
face
with
him
with
frantic
gestures
of
remonstrance
.


“
It
is
no
good
,
”
said
Syme
.

“
He
will
never
get
anything
out
of
that
old
heathen
.

I
vote
we
drive
bang
through
the
thick
of
them
,
bang
as
the
bullets
went
through
Bull
’s
hat
.

We
may
all
be
killed
,
but
we
must
kill
a
tidy
number
of
them
.
”


“
I
wo
n’t
‘
ave
it
,
”
said
Dr.
Bull
,
growing
more
vulgar
in
the
sincerity
of
his
virtue
.

“
The
poor
chaps
may
be
making
a
mistake
.

Give
the
Colonel
a
chance
.
”


“
Shall
we
go
back
,
then
?
”
asked
the
Professor
.


“
No
,
”
said
Ratcliffe
in
a
cold
voice
,
“
the
street
behind
us
is
held
too
.

In
fact
,
I
seem
to
see
there
another
friend
of
yours
,
Syme
.
”


Syme
spun
round
smartly
,
and
stared
backwards
at
the
track
which
they
had
travelled
.

He
saw
an
irregular
body
of
horsemen
gathering
and
galloping
towards
them
in
the
gloom
.

He
saw
above
the
foremost
saddle
the
silver
gleam
of
a
sword
,
and
then
as
it
grew
nearer
the
silver
gleam
of
an
old
man
’s
hair
.

The
next
moment
,
with
shattering
violence
,
he
had
swung
the
motor
round
and
sent
it
dashing
down
the
steep
side
street
to
the
sea
,
like
a
man
that
desired
only
to
die
.


“
What
the
devil
is
up
?
”
cried
the
Professor
,
seizing
his
arm
.


“
The
morning
star
has
fallen
!
”
said
Syme
,
as
his
own
car
went
down
the
darkness
like
a
falling
star
.


“
Comrade
Witherspoon
tells
us
,
”
resumed
Gregory
,
“
that
he
is
not
meek
.

Ah
,
how
little
he
knows
himself
!

His
words
are
,
indeed
,
extravagant
;
his
appearance
is
ferocious
,
and
even
(
to
an
ordinary
taste
)
unattractive
.

But
only
the
eye
of
a
friendship
as
deep
and
delicate
as
mine
can
perceive
the
deep
foundation
of
solid
meekness
which
lies
at
the
base
of
him
,
too
deep
even
for
himself
to
see
.

I
repeat
,
we
are
the
true
early
Christians
,
only
that
we
come
too
late
.

We
are
simple
,
as
they
revere
simple
—
look
at
Comrade
Witherspoon
.

We
are
modest
,
as
they
were
modest
—
look
at
me
.

We
are
merciful
—
”


“
No
,
no
!
”

called
out
Mr.
Witherspoon
with
the
velvet
jacket
.


“
I
say
we
are
merciful
,
”
repeated
Gregory
furiously
,
“
as
the
early
Christians
were
merciful
.

Yet
this
did
not
prevent
their
being
accused
of
eating
human
flesh
.

We
do
not
eat
human
flesh
—
”


“
Shame
!
”
cried
Witherspoon
.

“
Why
not
?
”


“
Comrade
Witherspoon
,
”
said
Gregory
,
with
a
feverish
gaiety
,
“
is
anxious
to
know
why
nobody
eats
him
(
laughter
)
.

In
our
society
,
at
any
rate
,
which
loves
him
sincerely
,
which
is
founded
upon
love
—
”


“
No
,
no
!
”
said
Witherspoon
,
“
down
with
love
.
”


“
Which
is
founded
upon
love
,
”
repeated
Gregory
,
grinding
his
teeth
,
“
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
the
aims
which
we
shall
pursue
as
a
body
,
or
which
I
should
pursue
were
I
chosen
as
the
representative
of
that
body
.

Superbly
careless
of
the
slanders
that
represent
us
as
assassins
and
enemies
of
human
society
,
we
shall
pursue
with
moral
courage
and
quiet
intellectual
pressure
,
the
permanent
ideals
of
brotherhood
and
simplicity
.
”


Gregory
resumed
his
seat
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
.

The
silence
was
sudden
and
awkward
,
but
the
chairman
rose
like
an
automaton
,
and
said
in
a
colourless
voice
—


“
Does
anyone
oppose
the
election
of
Comrade
Gregory
?
”


The
assembly
seemed
vague
and
sub‑consciously
disappointed
,
and
Comrade
Witherspoon
moved
restlessly
on
his
seat
and
muttered
in
his
thick
beard
.

By
the
sheer
rush
of
routine
,
however
,
the
motion
would
have
been
put
and
carried
.

But
as
the
chairman
was
opening
his
mouth
to
put
it
,
Syme
sprang
to
his
feet
and
said
in
a
small
and
quiet
voice
—


“
Yes
,
Mr.
Chairman
,
I
oppose
.
”


The
most
effective
fact
in
oratory
is
an
unexpected
change
in
the
voice
.

Mr.
Gabriel

Syme
evidently
understood
oratory
.

Having
said
these
first
formal
words
in
a
moderated
tone
and
with
a
brief
simplicity
,
he
made
his
next
word
ring
and
volley
in
the
vault
as
if
one
of
the
guns
had
gone
off
.


Syme
stood
up
before
any
of
the
others
.

The
instant
of
choice
had
come
at
last
,
the
pistol
was
at
his
head
.

On
the
pavement
before
he
could
hear
the
policeman
idly
stir
and
stamp
,
for
the
morning
,
though
bright
,
was
cold
.


A
barrel
‑
organ
in
the
street
suddenly
sprang
with
a
jerk
into
a
jovial
tune
.

Syme
stood
up
taut
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
bugle
before
the
battle
.

He
found
himself
filled
with
a
supernatural
courage
that
came
from
nowhere
.

That
jingling
music
seemed
full
of
the
vivacity
,
the
vulgarity
,
and
the
irrational
valour
of
the
poor
,
who
in
all
those
unclean
streets
were
all
clinging
to
the
decencies
and
the
charities
of
Christendom
.

His
youthful
prank
of
being
a
policeman
had
faded
from
his
mind
;
he
did
not
think
of
himself
as
the
representative
of
the
corps
of
gentlemen
turned
into
fancy
constables
,
or
of
the
old
eccentric
who
lived
in
the
dark
room
.

But
he
did
feel
himself
as
the
ambassador
of
all
these
common
and
kindly
people
in
the
street
,
who
every
day
marched
into
battle
to
the
music
of
the
barrel
-
organ
.

And
this
high
pride
in
being
human
had
lifted
him
unaccountably
to
an
infinite
height
above
the
monstrous
men
around
him
.

For
an
instant
,
at
least
,
he
looked
down
upon
all
their
sprawling
eccentricities
from
the
starry
pinnacle
of
the
commonplace
.

He
felt
towards
them
all
that
unconscious
and
elementary
superiority
that
a
brave
man
feels
over
powerful
beasts
or
a
wise
man
over
powerful
errors
.

He
knew
that
he
had
neither
the
intellectual
nor
the
physical
strength
of
President
Sunday
;
but
in
that
moment
he
minded
it
no
more
than
the
fact
that
he
had
not
the
muscles
of
a
tiger
or
a
horn
on
his
nose
like
a
rhinoceros
.

All
was
swallowed
up
in
an
ultimate
certainty
that
the
President
was
wrong
and
that
the
barrel
‑
organ
was
right
.

There
clanged
in
his
mind
that
unanswerable
and
terrible
truism
in
the
song
of
Roland
—


“
Païens
ont
tort
et
Chrétiens
ont
droit
.
”


which
in
the
old
nasal
French
has
the
clang
and
groan
of
great
iron
.

This
liberation
of
his
spirit
from
the
load
of
his
weakness
went
with
a
quite
clear
decision
to
embrace
death
.

If
the
people
of
the
barrel
‑
organ
could
keep
their
old
‑
world
obligations
,
so
could
he
.

This
very
pride
in
keeping
his
word
was
that
he
was
keeping
it
to
miscreants
.

It
was
his
last
triumph
over
these
lunatics
to
go
down
into
their
dark
room
and
die
for
something
that
they
could
not
even
understand
.

The
barrel
‑
organ
seemed
to
give
the
marching
tune
with
the
energy
and
the
mingled
noises
of
a
whole
orchestra
;
and
he
could
hear
deep
and
rolling
,
under
all
the
trumpets
of
the
pride
of
life
,
the
drums
of
the
pride
of
death
.


“
I
must
protest
,
President
,
that
the
thing
is
irregular
,
”
he
said
.

“
It
is
a
fundamental
rule
of
our
society
that
all
plans
shall
be
debated
in
full
council
.

Of
course
,
I
fully
appreciate
your
forethought
when
in
the
actual
presence
of
a
traitor
—
”


“
Secretary
,
”
said
the
President
seriously
,
“
if
you
’d
take
your
head
home
and
boil
it
for
a
turnip
it
might
be
useful
.

I
ca
n’t
say
.

But
it
might
.


The
Secretary
reared
back
in
a
kind
of
equine
anger
.


“
I
really
fail
to
understand
—
”
he
began
in
high
offense
.


“
That
’s
it
,
that
’s
it
,
”
said
the
President
,
nodding
a
great
many
times
.

“
That
’s
where
you
fail
right
enough
.

You
fail
to
understand
.

Why
,
you
dancing
donkey
,
”
he
roared
,
rising
,
“
you
did
n’t
want
to
be
overheard
by
a
spy
,
did
n’t
you
?

How
do
you
know
you
are
n’t
overheard
now
?
”


And
with
these
words
he
shouldered
his
way
out
of
the
room
,
shaking
with
incomprehensible
scorn
.


Four
of
the
men
left
behind
gaped
after
him
without
any
apparent
glimmering
of
his
meaning
.

Syme
alone
had
even
a
glimmering
,
and
such
as
it
was
it
froze
him
to
the
bone
.

If
the
last
words
of
the
President
meant
anything
,
they
meant
that
he
had
not
after
all
passed
unsuspected
.

They
meant
that
while
Sunday
could
not
denounce
him
like
Gogol
,
he
still
could
not
trust
him
like
the
others
.


The
other
four
got
to
their
feet
grumbling
more
or
less
,
and
betook
themselves
elsewhere
to
find
lunch
,
for
it
was
already
well
past
midday
.

The
Professor
went
last
,
very
slowly
and
painfully
.

Syme
sat
long
after
the
rest
had
gone
,
revolving
his
strange
position
.

He
had
escaped
a
thunderbolt
,
but
he
was
still
under
a
cloud
.

At
last
he
rose
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
hotel
into
Leicester
Square
.

The
bright
,
cold
day
had
grown
increasingly
colder
,
and
when
he
came
out
into
the
street
he
was
surprised
by
a
few
flakes
of
snow
.

While
he
still
carried
the
sword
‑
stick
and
the
rest
of
Gregory
’s
portable
luggage
,
he
had
thrown
the
cloak
down
and
left
it
somewhere
,
perhaps
on
the
steam
‑
tug
,
perhaps
on
the
balcony
.

Hoping
,
therefore
,
that
the
snow
‑
shower
might
be
slight
,
he
stepped
back
out
of
the
street
for
a
moment
and
stood
up
under
the
doorway
of
a
small
and
greasy
hair
‑
dresser
’s
shop
,
the
front
window
of
which
was
empty
,
except
for
a
sickly
wax
lady
in
evening
dress
.


“
This
is
more
cheerful
,
”
said
Dr.
Bull
;
“
we
are
six
men
going
to
ask
one
man
what
he
means
.
”


“
I
think
it
is
a
bit
queerer
than
that
,
”
said
Syme
.

“
I
think
it
is
six
men
going
to
ask
one
man
what
they
mean
.
”


They
turned
in
silence
into
the
Square
,
and
though
the
hotel
was
in
the
opposite
corner
,
they
saw
at
once
the
little
balcony
and
a
figure
that
looked
too
big
for
it
.

He
was
sitting
alone
with
bent
head
,
poring
over
a
newspaper
.

But
all
his
councillors
,
who
had
come
to
vote
him
down
,
crossed
that
Square
as
if
they
were
watched
out
of
heaven
by
a
hundred
eyes
.


They
had
disputed
much
upon
their
policy
,
about
whether
they
should
leave
the
unmasked
Gogol
without
and
begin
diplomatically
,
or
whether
they
should
bring
him
in
and
blow
up
the
gunpowder
at
once
.

The
influence
of
Syme
and
Bull
prevailed
for
the
latter
course
,
though
the
Secretary
to
the
last
asked
them
why
they
attacked
Sunday
so
rashly
.


“
My
reason
is
quite
simple
,
”
said
Syme
.

“
I
attack
him
rashly
because
I
am
afraid
of
him
.
”


They
followed

Syme
up
the
dark
stair
in
silence
,
and
they
all
came
out
simultaneously
into
the
broad
sunlight
of
the
morning
and
the
broad
sunlight
of
Sunday
’s
smile
.


“
Delightful
!
”

he
said
.

“
So
pleased
to
see
you
all
.

What
an
exquisite
day
it
is
.

Is
the
Czar
dead
?
”


The
Secretary
,
who
happened
to
be
foremost
,
drew
himself
together
for
a
dignified
outburst
.


“
No
,
sir
,
”
he
said
sternly
“
there
has
been
no
massacre
.

I
bring
you
news
of
no
such
disgusting
spectacles
.
”


“
Disgusting
spectacles
?
”

repeated
the
President
,
with
a
bright
,
inquiring
smile
.

“
You
mean
Dr.
Bull
’s
spectacles
?
”


The
Secretary
choked
for
a
moment
,
and
the
President
went
on
with
a
sort
of
smooth
appeal
—


“
Of
course
,
we
all
have
our
opinions
and
even
our
eyes
,
but
really
to
call
them
disgusting
before
the
man
himself
—
”


Dr.
Bull
tore
off
his
spectacles
and
broke
them
on
the
table
.


“
My
spectacles
are
blackguardly
,
”
he
said
,
“
but
I
’m
not
.

Look
at
my
face
.
”


“
I
dare
say
it
’s
the
sort
of
face
that
grows
on
one
,
”
said
the
President
,
“
in
fact
,
it
grows
on
you
;
and
who
am
I
to
quarrel
with
the
wild
fruits
upon
the
Tree
of
Life
?

I
dare
say
it
will
grow
on
me
some
day
.
”


“
We
have
no
time
for
tomfoolery
,
”
said
the
Secretary
,
breaking
in
savagely
.

“
We
have
come
to
know
what
all
this
means
.

Who
are
you
?

What
are
you
?

Why
did
you
get
us
all
here
?

Do
you
know
who
and
what
we
are
?

Are
you
a
half
‑
witted
man
playing
the
conspirator
,
or
are
you
a
clever
man
playing
the
fool
?

Answer
me
,
I
tell
you
.
”
