“
Nonsense
,
pooh
!
”
said
the
Psammead
.

“
that
was
n’t
the
other
half
.

It
was
the
same
half
that
you
’ve
got
—
the
one
that
was
n’t
crushed
and
lost
.
”


“
But
how
could
it
be
the
same
?
”
said
Anthea
gently
.


“
Well
,
not
exactly
,
of
course
.

The
one
you
’ve
got
is
a
good
many
years
older
,
but
at
any
rate
it
’s
not
the
other
one
.

What
did
you
say
when
you
wished
?
”


“
I
forget
,
”
said
Jane
.


“
I
do
n’t
,
”
said
the
Psammead
.

“
You
said
,
‘
Take
us
where
you
are
’—
and
it
did
,
so
you
see
it
was
the
same
half
.
”


“
I
see
,
”
said
Anthea
.


“
But
you
mark
my
words
,
”
the
Psammead
went
on
,
“
you
’ll
have
trouble
with
that
Priest
yet
.
”


“
Why
,
he
was
quite
friendly
,
”
said
Anthea
.


“
All
the
same
you
’d
better
beware
of
the
Reverend
Rekh
‐
marā
.
”


“
Oh
,
I
’m
sick
of
the
Amulet
,
”
said
Cyril
,
“
we
shall
never
get
it
.
”


“
Oh
yes
we
shall
,
”
said
Robert
.

“
Do
n’t
you
remember
December
3rd
?
”


“
Jinks
!
”
said
Cyril
,
“
I
’d
forgotten
that
.
”


“
I
do
n’t
believe
it
,
”
said
Jane
,
“
and
I
do
n’t
feel
at
all
well
.
”


“
If
I
were
you
,
”
said
the
Psammead
,
“
I
should
not
go
out
into
the
Past
again
till
that
date
.

You
’ll
find
it
safer
not
to
go
where
you
’re
likely
to
meet
that
Egyptian
any
more
just
at
present
.
”


“
Of
course
we
’ll
do
as
you
say
,
”
said
Anthea
soothingly
,
“
though
there
’s
something
about
his
face
that
I
really
do
like
.
”


“
Still
,
you
do
n’t
want
to
run
after
him
,
I
suppose
,
”
snapped
the
Psammead
.

“
You
wait
till
the
3rd
,
and
then
see
what
happens
.
”


Cyril
and
Jane
were
feeling
far
from
well
,
Anthea
was
always
obliging
,
so
Robert
was
overruled
.

And
they
promised
.

And
none
of
them
,
not
even
the
Psammead
,
at
all
foresaw
,
as
you
no
doubt
do
quite
plainly
,
exactly
what
it
was
that
would
happen
on
that
memorable
date
.


IF
I
only
had
time
I
could
tell
you
lots
of
things
.

For
instance
,
how
,
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
the
Psammead
,
the
four
children
did
,
one
very
wet
day
,
go
through
their
Amulet
Arch
into
the
golden
desert
,
and
there
find
the
great
Temple
of
Baalbec
and
meet
with
the
Phœnix
whom
they
never
thought
to
see
again
.

And
how
the
Phœnix
did
not
remember
them
at
all
until
it
went
into
a
sort
of
prophetic
trance
—
if
that
can
be
called
remembering
.

But
,
alas
!

I
have
n’t
time
,
so
I
must
leave
all
that
out
though
it
was
a
wonderfully
thrilling
adventure
.

I
must
leave
out
,
too
,
all
about
the
visit
of
the
children
to
the
Hippodrome
with
the
Psammead
in
its
travelling
bag
,
and
about
how
the
wishes
of
the
people
round
about
them
were
granted
so
suddenly
and
surprisingly
that
at
last
the
Psammead
had
to
be
taken
hurriedly
home
by
Anthea
,
who
consequently
missed
half
the
performance
.

Then
there
was
the
time
when
,
Nurse
having
gone
to
tea
with
a
friend
out
Ivalunk
way
,
they
were
playing
“
devil
in
the
dark
”
—
and
in
the
midst
of
that
most
creepy
pastime
the
postman
’s
knock
frightened
Jane
nearly
out
of
her
life
.

She
took
in
the
letters
,
however
,
and
put
them
in
the
back
of
the
hat
‐
stand
drawer
,
so
that
they
should
be
safe
.

And
safe
they
were
,
for
she
never
thought
of
them
again
for
weeks
and
weeks
.


“
Then
prison
’s
the
best
place
for
them
,
”
said
the
Queen
.


“
But
suppose
neither
did
it
.
”


“
That
’s
impossible
,
”
said
the
Queen
;
“
a
thing
’s
not
done
unless
some
one
does
it
.

And
you
must
n’t
interrupt
.
”


Then
came
a
woman
,
in
tears
,
with
a
torn
veil
and
real
ashes
on
her
head
—
at
least
Anthea
thought
so
,
but
it
may
have
been
only
road
‐
dust
.

She
complained
that
her
husband
was
in
prison
.


“
What
for
?
”
said
the
Queen
.


“
They
said
it
was
for
speaking
evil
of
your
Majesty
,
”
said
the
woman
,
“
but
it
was
n’t
.

Some
one
had
a
spite
against
him
.

That
was
what
it
was
.
”


“
How
do
you
know
he
had
n’t
spoken
evil
of
me
?
”
said
the
Queen
.


“
No
one
could
,
”
said
the
woman
simply
,
“
when
they
’d
once
seen
your
beautiful
face
.
”


“
Let
the
man
out
,
”
said
the
Queen
,
smiling
.

“
Next
case
.
”


The
next
case
was
that
of
a
boy
who
had
stolen
a
fox
.

“
Like
the
Spartan
boy
,
”
whispered
Robert
.

But
the
Queen
ruled
that
nobody
could
have
any
possible
reason
for
owning
a
fox
,
and
still
less
for
stealing
one
.

And
she
did
not
believe
that
there
were
any
foxes
in
Babylon
;
she
,
at
any
rate
,
had
never
seen
one
.

So
the
boy
was
released
.


The
people
came
to
the
Queen
about
all
sorts
of
family
quarrels
and
neighbourly
misunderstandings
—
from
a
fight
between
brothers
over
the
division
of
an
inheritance
,
to
the
dishonest
and
unfriendly
conduct
of
a
woman
who
had
borrowed
a
cooking
‐
pot
at
the
last
New
Year
’s
festival
,
and
not
returned
it
yet
.


And
the
Queen
decided
everything
,
very
,
very
decidedly
indeed
.

At
last
she
clapped
her
hands
quite
suddenly
and
with
extreme
loudness
,
and
said
—


“
The
audience
is
over
for
today
.
”


Every
one
said
,
“
May
the
Queen
live
for
ever
!
”
and
went
out
.


And
the
children
were
left
alone
in
the
justice
‐
hall
with
the
Queen
of
Babylon
and
her
ladies
.


“
There
!
”
said
the
Queen
,
with
a
long
sigh
of
relief
.

“
That
’s
over
!

I
could
n’t
have
done
another
stitch
of
justice
if
you
’d
offered
me
the
crown
of
Egypt
!

Now
come
into
the
garden
,
and
we
’ll
have
a
nice
,
long
,
cosy
talk
.
”


She
led
them
through
long
,
narrow
corridors
whose
walls
they
somehow
felt
,
were
very
,
very
thick
,
into
a
sort
of
garden
courtyard
.

There
were
thick
shrubs
closely
planted
,
and
roses
were
trained
over
trellises
,
and
made
a
pleasant
shade
—
needed
,
indeed
,
for
already
the
sun
was
as
hot
as
it
is
in
England
in
August
at
the
seaside
.


The
Psammead
,
roused
from
its
sound
sleep
,
told
the
same
story
.


“
But
,
”
it
added
,
“
what
possessed
you
to
tell
that
Queen
that
I
could
give
wishes
?

I
sometimes
think
you
were
born
without
even
the
most
rudimentary
imitation
of
brains
.
”


The
children
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
rudimentary
,
but
it
sounded
a
rude
,
insulting
word
.


“
I
do
n’t
see
that
we
did
any
harm
,
”
said
Cyril
sulkily
.


“
Oh
,
no
,
”
said
the
Psammead
with
withering
irony
,
“
not
at
all
!

Of
course
not
!

Quite
the
contrary
!

Exactly
so
!

Only
she
happened
to
wish
that
she
might
soon
find
herself
in
your
country
.

And
soon
may
mean
any
moment
.
”


“
Then
it
’s
your
fault
,
”
said
Robert
,
“
because
you
might
just
as
well
have
made
‘
soon
’
mean
some
moment
next
year
or
next
century
.
”


“
That
’s
where
you
,
as
so
often
happens
,
make
the
mistake
,
”
rejoined
the
Sand
‐
fairy
.

“
I
could
n’t
mean
anything
but
what
she
meant
by
‘
soon
.
’

It
was
n’t
my
wish
.

And
what
she
meant
was
the
next
time
the
King
happens
to
go
out
lion
hunting
.

So
she
’ll
have
a
whole
day
,
and
perhaps
two
,
to
do
as
she
wishes
with
.

She
does
n’t
know
about
time
only
being
a
mode
of
thought
.
”


“
Well
,
”
said
Cyril
,
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
,
“
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
give
her
a
good
time
.

She
was
jolly
decent
to
us
.

I
say
,
suppose
we
were
to
go
to
St
James
’s
Park
after
dinner
and
feed
those
ducks
that
we
never
did
feed
.

After
all
that
Babylon
and
all
those
years
ago
,
I
feel
as
if
I
should
like
to
see
something
real
,
and
now
.

You
’ll
come
,
Psammead
?
”


“
Where
’s
my
priceless
woven
basket
of
sacred
rushes
?
”
asked
the
Psammead
morosely
.

“
I
ca
n’t
go
out
with
nothing
on
.

And
I
wo
n’t
,
what
’s
more
.
”


And
then
everybody
remembered
with
pain
that
the
bass
bag
had
,
in
the
hurry
of
departure
from
Babylon
,
not
been
remembered
.


“
But
it
’s
not
so
extra
precious
,
”
said
Robert
hastily
.

“
You
can
get
them
given
to
you
for
nothing
if
you
buy
fish
in
Farringdon
Market
.
”


“
Oh
,
”
said
the
Psammead
very
crossly
indeed
,
“
so
you
presume
on
my
sublime
indifference
to
the
things
of
this
disgusting
modern
world
,
to
fob
me
off
with
a
travelling
equipage
that
costs
you
nothing
.

Very
well
,
I
shall
go
to
sand
.

Please
do
n’t
wake
me
.
”


And
it
went
then
and
there
to
sand
,
which
,
as
you
know
,
meant
to
bed
.

The
boys
went
to
St
James
’s
Park
to
feed
the
ducks
,
but
they
went
alone
.


They
could
see
from
the
balcony
the
sea‐
captain
edging
his
way
out
from
among
the
people
.

And
his
face
was
dead
white
,
like
paper
.


“
To
the
hills
!
”

he
cried
in
a
loud
and
terrible
voice
.

And
above
his
voice
came
another
voice
,
louder
,
more
terrible
—
the
voice
of
the
sea
.


The
girls
looked
seaward
.


Across
the
smooth
distance
of
the
sea
something
huge
and
black
rolled
towards
the
town
.

It
was
a
wave
,
but
a
wave
a
hundred
feet
in
height
,
a
wave
that
looked
like
a
mountain—a
wave
rising
higher
and
higher
till
suddenly
it
seemed
to
break
in
two
—
one
half
of
it
rushed
out
to
sea
again
;
the
other
—


“
Oh
!
”
cried
Anthea
,
“
the
town
—
the
poor
people
!
”


“
It
’s
all
thousands
of
years
ago
,
really
,
”
said
Robert
but
his
voice
trembled
.

They
hid
their
eyes
for
a
moment
.

They
could
not
bear
to
look
down
,
for
the
wave
had
broken
on
the
face
of
the
town
,
sweeping
over
the
quays
and
docks
,
overwhelming
the
great
storehouses
and
factories
,
tearing
gigantic
stones
from
forts
and
bridges
,
and
using
them
as
battering
rams
against
the
temples
.

Great
ships
were
swept
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
dashed
down
half
‐
way
up
the
hill
among
ruined
gardens
and
broken
buildings
.

The
water
ground
brown
fishing
‐
boats
to
powder
on
the
golden
roofs
of
Palaces
.


Then
the
wave
swept
back
towards
the
sea
.


“
I
want
to
go
home
,
”
cried
the
Psammead
fiercely
.


“
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
”
said
Jane
,
and
the
boys
were
ready
—
but
the
learned
gentleman
had
not
come
.


Then
suddenly
they
heard
him
dash
up
to
the
inner
gallery
,
crying
—


“
I
must
see
the
end
of
the
dream
.
”

He
rushed
up
the
higher
flight
.

The
others
followed
him
.

They
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
turret
—
roofed
,
but
open
to
the
air
at
the
sides
.


The
learned
gentleman
was
leaning
on
the
parapet
,
and
as
they
rejoined
him
the
vast
wave
rushed
back
on
the
town
.

This
time
it
rose
higher
—
destroyed
more
.


“
Come
home
,
”
cried
the
Psammead
;
“
that
’s
the
last
,
I
know
it
is
!

That
’s
the
last
—
over
there
.
”

It
pointed
with
a
claw
that
trembled
.


“
Oh
,
come
!
”
cried

Jane
,
holding
up
the
Amulet
.


“
I
will
see
the
end
of
the
dream
,
”
cried
the
learned
gentleman
.


“
You
’ll
never
see
anything
else
if
you
do
,
”
said
Cyril
.


“
Oh
,
Jimmy
!
”
appealed
Anthea
.

“
I
’ll
never
bring
you
out
again
!
”


“
You
’ll
never
have
the
chance
if
you
do
n’t
go
soon
,
”
said
the
Psammead
.


“
Oh
,
yes
;
you
know
everything
,
”
Robert
replied
.

“
What
’s
all
that
grey
‐
green
stuff
you
see
away
over
there
,
where
it
’s
all
flat
and
sandy
?
”


“
All
right
,
”
said
Cyril
loftily
,
“
I
do
n’t
want
to
tell
you
anything
.

I
only
thought
you
’d
like
to
know
a
palm
‐
tree
when
you
saw
it
again
.
”


“
Look
!
”
cried

Anthea
;
“
they
’re
opening
the
gates
.
”


And
indeed
the
great
gates
swung
back
with
a
brazen
clang
,
and
instantly
a
little
crowd
of
a
dozen
or
more
people
came
out
and
along
the
road
towards
them
.


The
children
,
with
one
accord
,
crouched
behind
the
tamarisk
hedge
.


“
I
do
n’t
like
the
sound
of
those
gates
,
”
said
Jane
.

“
Fancy
being
inside
when
they
shut
.

You
’d
never
get
out
.
”


“
You
’ve
got
an
arch
of
your
own
to
go
out
by
,
”
the
Psammead
put
it
s
head
out
of
the
basket
to
remind
her
.

“
Do
n’t
behave
so
like
a
girl
.

If
I
were
you
I
should
just
march
right
into
the
town
and
ask
to
see
the
king
.
”


There
was
something
at
once
simple
and
grand
about
this
idea
,
and
it
pleased
everyone
.


So
when
the
work
‐
people
had
passed
(
they
were
work
‐
people
,
the
children
felt
sure
,
because
they
were
dressed
so
plainly
—
just
one
long
blue
shirt
thing
—
of
blue
or
yellow
)
the
four
children
marched
boldly
up
to
the
brazen
gate
between
the
towers
.

The
arch
above
the
gate
was
quite
a
tunnel
,
the
walls
were
so
thick
.


“
Courage
,
”
said
Cyril
.

“
Step
out
.

It
’s
no
use
trying
to
sneak
past
.

Be
bold
!
”


Robert
answered
this
appeal
by
unexpectedly
bursting
into
“
The
British
Grenadiers
,
”
and
to
its
quick
‐
step
they
approached
the
gates
of
Babylon
.


This
brought
them
to
the
threshold
of
the
gate
,
and
two
men
in
bright
armour
suddenly
barred
their
way
with
crossed
spears
.


“
Who
goes
there
?
”

they
said
.


(
I
think
I
must
have
explained
to
you
before
how
it
was
that
the
children
were
always
able
to
understand
the
language
of
any
place
they
might
happen
to
be
in
,
and
to
be
themselves
understood
.

If
not
,
I
have
no
time
to
explain
it
now
.
)


“
We
come
from
very
far
,
”
said
Cyril
mechanically
.

“
From
the
Empire
where
the
sun
never
sets
,
and
we
want
to
see
your
King
.
”


“
If
it
’s
quite
convenient
,
”
amended
Anthea
.


“
The
King
(
may
he
live
for
ever
!
)
,
”
said
the
gatekeeper
,
“
is
gone
to
fetch
home
his
fourteenth
wife
.

Where
on
earth
have
you
come
from
not
to
know
that
?
”


“
The
Queen
then
,
”
said
Anthea
hurriedly
,
and
not
taking
any
notice
of
the
question
as
to
where
they
had
come
from
.
