"
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
intrude
,
"
began
Leonard
,
in
answer
to
Margaret
's
question
.

"
But
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
in
the
past
in
warning
me
about
the
Porphyrion
that
I
wondered
—
why
,
I
wondered
whether
—
"


"
Whether
we
could
get
him
back
into
the
Porphyrion
again
,
"
supplied
Helen
.

"
Meg
,
this
has
been
a
cheerful
business
.

A
bright
evening
's
work
that
was
on
Chelsea
Embankment
.
"


Margaret
shook
her
head
and
returned
to
Mr.
Bast
.


"
I
do
n't
understand
.

You
left
the
Porphyrion
because
we
suggested
it
was
a
bad
concern
,
did
n't
you
?
"


"
That
's
right
.
"


"
And
went
into
a
bank
instead
?
"


"
I
told
you
all
that
,
"
said
Helen
;
"
and
they
reduced
their
staff
after
he
had
been
in
a
month
,
and
now
he
's
penniless
,
and
I
consider
that
we
and
our
informant
are
directly
to
blame
.
"


"
I
hate
all
this
,
"
Leonard
muttered
.


"
I
hope
you
do
,
Mr.
Bast
.

But
it
's
no
good
mincing
matters
.

You
have
done
yourself
no
good
by
coming
here
.

If
you
intend
to
confront
Mr.
Wilcox
,
and
to
call
him
to
account
for
a
chance
remark
,
you
will
make
a
very
great
mistake
.
"


"
I
brought
them
.

I
did
it
all
,
"
cried
Helen
.


"
I
can
only
advise
you
to
go
at
once
.

My
sister
has
put
you
in
a
false
position
,
and
it
is
kindest
to
tell
you
so
.

It
's
too
late
to
get
to
town
,
but
you
'll
find
a
comfortable
hotel
in
Oniton
,
where
Mrs.
Bast
can
rest
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
be
my
guests
there
.
"


"
That
is
n't
what
I
want
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
"
said
Leonard
.

"
You
're
very
kind
,
and
no
doubt
it
's
a
false
position
,
but
you
make
me
miserable
.

I
seem
no
good
at
all
.
"


"
It
's
work
he
wants
,
"
interpreted
Helen
.

"
Ca
n't
you
see
?
"


Then
he
said
:
"
Jacky
,
let
's
go
.

We
're
more
bother
than
we
're
worth
.

We
're
costing
these
ladies
pounds
and
pounds
already
to
get
work
for
us
,
and
they
never
will
.

There
's
nothing
we
're
good
enough
to
do
.
"


"
We
would
like
to
find
you
work
,
"
said
Margaret
rather
conventionally
.

"
We
want
to
—I
,
like
my
sister
.

You
're
only
down
in
your
luck
.

Go
to
the
hotel
,
have
a
good
night
's
rest
,
and
some
day
you
shall
pay
me
back
the
bill
,
if
you
prefer
it
.
"


But
Leonard
was
near
the
abyss
,
and
at
such
moments
men
see
clearly
.

"
You
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
,
"
he
said
.

"
I
shall
never
get
work
now
.

If
rich
people
fail
at
one
profession
,
they
can
try
another
.

Not
I
.

I
had
my
groove
,
and
I
've
got
out
of
it
.

I
could
do
one
particular
branch
of
insurance
in
one
particular
office
well
enough
to
command
a
salary
,
but
that
's
all
.

Poetry
's
nothing
,
Miss
Schlegel
.

One
's
thoughts
about
this
and
that
are
nothing
.

Your
money
,
too
,
is
nothing
,
if
you
'll
understand
me
.

I
mean
if
a
man
over
twenty
once
loses
his
own
particular
job
,
it
's
all
over
with
him
.

I
have
seen
it
happen
to
others
.

Their
friends
gave
them
money
for
a
little
,
but
in
the
end
they
fall
over
the
edge
.

It
's
no
good
.

It
's
the
whole
world
pulling
.

There
always
will
be
rich
and
poor
.
"


"
Indeed
!
"


"
We
took
the
flat
chiefly
on
that
account
,
and
also
that
Paul
could
get
his
African
outfit
.

The
flat
belongs
to
a
cousin
of
my
husband
's
,
and
she
most
kindly
offered
it
to
us
.

So
before
the
day
came
we
were
able
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Dolly
's
people
,
which
we
had
not
yet
done
.
"


Margaret
asked
who
Dolly
's
people
were
.


"
Fussell
.

The
father
is
in
the
Indian
army
—
retired
;
the
brother
is
in
the
army
.

The
mother
is
dead
.
"


So
perhaps
these
were
the
"
chinless
sunburnt
men
"
whom
Helen
had
espied
one
afternoon
through
the
window
.

Margaret
felt
mildly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
the
Wilcox
family
.

She
had
acquired
the
habit
on
Helen
's
account
,
and
it
still
clung
to
her
.

She
asked
for
more
information
about
Miss
Dolly

Fussell
that
was
,
and
was
given
it
in
even
,
unemotional
tones
.

Mrs.
Wilcox
's
voice
,
though
sweet
and
compelling
,
had
little
range
of
expression
.

It
suggested
that
pictures
,
concerts
,
and
people
are
all
of
small
and
equal
value
.

Only
once
had
it
quickened
—
when
speaking
of
Howards
End
.


"
Charles
and
Albert
Fussell
have
known
one
another
some
time
.

They
belong
to
the
same
club
,
and
are
both
devoted
to
golf
.

Dolly
plays
golf
too
,
though
I
believe
not
so
well
,
and
they
first
met
in
a
mixed
foursome
.

We
all
like
her
,
and
are
very
much
pleased
.

They
were
married
on
the
11th
,
a
few
days
before
Paul
sailed
.

Charles
was
very
anxious
to
have
his
brother
as
best
man
,
so
he
made
a
great
point
of
having
it
on
the
11th
.

The
Fussells
would
have
preferred
it
after
Christmas
,
but
they
were
very
nice
about
it
.

There
is
Dolly
's
photograph
—
in
that
double
frame
.
"


"
Are
you
quite
certain
that
I
'm
not
interrupting
,
Mrs.
Wilcox
?
"


"
Yes
,
quite
.
"


"
Then
I
will
stay
.

I
'm
enjoying
this
.
"


Dolly
's
photograph
was
now
examined
.

It
was
signed
"
For
dear
Mims
,
"
which
Mrs.
Wilcox
interpreted
as
"
the
name
she
and
Charles
had
settled
that
she
should
call
me
.
"

Dolly
looked
silly
,
and
had
one
of
those
triangular
faces
that
so
often
prove
attractive
to
a
robust
man
.

She
was
very
pretty
.

From
her
Margaret
passed
to
Charles
,
whose
features
prevailed
opposite
.

She
speculated
on
the
forces
that
had
drawn
the
two
together
till
God
parted
them
.

She
found
time
to
hope
that
they
would
be
happy
.


"
They
have
gone
to
Naples
for
their
honeymoon
.
"


"
Lucky
people
!
"


"
I
can
hardly
imagine
Charles
in
Italy
.
"


"
Yes
,
that
is
so
,
"
conceded
Frieda
;
and
another
international
incident
was
closed
.


"
'
Bournemouth
is
,
'
"
resumed
their
hostess
,
quoting
a
local
rhyme
to
which
she
was
much
attached
—
"
'
Bournemouth
is
,
Poole
was
,
and
Swanage
is
to
be
the
most
important
town
of
all
and
biggest
of
the
three
.
'

Now
,
Frau
Liesecke
,
I
have
shown
you
Bournemouth
,
and
I
have
shown
you
Poole
,
so
let
us
walk
backward
a
little
,
and
look
down
again
at
Swanage
.
"


"
Aunt
Juley
,
would
n't
that
be
Meg
's
train
?
"


A
tiny
puff
of
smoke
had
been
circling
the
harbour
,
and
now
was
bearing
southwards
towards
them
over
the
black
and
the
gold
.


"
Oh
,
dearest
Margaret
,
I
do
hope
she
wo
n't
be
overtired
.
"


"
Oh
,
I
do
wonder
—I
do
wonder
whether
she
's
taken
the
house
.
"


"
I
hope
she
has
n't
been
hasty
.
"


"
So
do
I
—
oh
,
so
do
I
.
"


"
Will
it
be
as
beautiful
as
Wickham
Place
?
"

Frieda
asked
.


"
I
should
think
it
would
.

Trust
Mr.
Wilcox
for
doing
himself
proud
.

All
those
Ducie
Street
houses
are
beautiful
in
their
modern
way
,
and
I
ca
n't
think
why
he
does
n't
keep
on
with
it
.

But
it
's
really
for
Evie
that
he
went
there
,
and
now
that
Evie
's
going
to
be
married
—
"


"
Ah
!
"


"
You
've
never
seen
Miss
Wilcox
,
Frieda
.

How
absurdly
matrimonial
you
are
!
"


"
But
sister
to
that
Paul
?
"


"
Yes
.
"


"
And
to
that
Charles
,
"
said
Mrs.
Munt
with
feeling
.

"
Oh
,
Helen
,
Helen
,
what
a
time
that
was
!
"


Helen
laughed
.

"
Meg
and
I
have
n't
got
such
tender
hearts
.

If
there
's
a
chance
of
a
cheap
house
,
we
go
for
it
.
"


"
Now
look
,
Frau
Liesecke
,
at
my
niece
's
train
.

You
see
,
it
is
coming
towards
us
—
coming
,
coming
;
and
,
when
it
gets
to
Corfe
,
it
will
actually
go
through
the
downs
,
on
which
we
are
standing
,
so
that
,
if
we
walk
over
,
as
I
suggested
,
and
look
down
on
Swanage
,
we
shall
see
it
coming
on
the
other
side
.

Shall
we
?
"


Frieda
assented
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
crossed
the
ridge
and
exchanged
the
greater
view
for
the
lesser
.

Rather
a
dull
valley
lay
below
,
backed
by
the
slope
of
the
coastward
downs
.

They
were
looking
across
the
Isle
of
Purbeck
and
on
to
Swanage
,
soon
to
be
the
most
important
town
of
all
,
and
ugliest
of
the
three
.

Margaret
's
train
reappeared
as
promised
,
and
was
greeted
with
approval
by
her
aunt
.

It
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
middle
distance
,
and
there
it
had
been
planned
that
Tibby
should
meet
her
,
and
drive
her
,
and
a
tea
-
basket
,
up
to
join
them
.


"
Ten
years
ago
.
"


She
left
him
without
a
word
.

For
it
was
not
her
tragedy
:
it
was
Mrs.
Wilcox
's
.


Helen
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
spent
a
matter
of
eight
pounds
in
making
some
people
ill
and
others
angry
.

Now
that
the
wave
of
excitement
was
ebbing
,
and
had
left
her
,
Mr.
Bast
,
and
Mrs.
Bast
stranded
for
the
night
in
a
Shropshire
hotel
,
she
asked
herself
what
forces
had
made
the
wave
flow
.

At
all
events
,
no
harm
was
done
.

Margaret
would
play
the
game
properly
now
,
and
though
Helen
disapproved
of
her
sister
's
methods
,
she
knew
that
the
Basts
would
benefit
by
them
in
the
long
run
.


"
Mr.
Wilcox
is
so
illogical
,
"
she
explained
to
Leonard
,
who
had
put
his
wife
to
bed
,
and
was
sitting
with
her
in
the
empty
coffee
-
room
.

"
If
we
told
him
it
was
his
duty
to
take
you
on
,
he
might
refuse
to
do
it
.

The
fact
is
,
he
is
n't
properly
educated
.

I
do
n't
want
to
set
you
against
him
,
but
you
'll
find
him
a
trial
.
"


"
I
can
never
thank
you
sufficiently
,
Miss
Schlegel
,
"
was
all
that
Leonard
felt
equal
to
.


"
I
believe
in
personal
responsibility
.

Do
n't
you
?

And
in
personal
everything
.

I
hate
—
I
suppose
I
ought
n't
to
say
that
—
but
the
Wilcoxes
are
on
the
wrong
tack
surely
.

Or
perhaps
it
is
n't
their
fault
.

Perhaps
the
little
thing
that
says
'
I
'
is
missing
out
of
the
middle
of
their
heads
,
and
then
it
's
a
waste
of
time
to
blame
them
.

There
's
a
nightmare
of
a
theory
that
says
a
special
race
is
being
born
which
will
rule
the
rest
of
us
in
the
future
just
because
it
lacks
the
little
thing
that
says
'
I
.
'

Had
you
heard
that
?
"


"
I
get
no
time
for
reading
.
"


"
Had
you
thought
it
,
then
?

That
there
are
two
kinds
of
people
—
our
kind
,
who
live
straight
from
the
middle
of
their
heads
,
and
the
other
kind
who
ca
n't
,
because
their
heads
have
no
middle
?

They
ca
n't
say
'
I
.
'

They
are
n't
in
fact
,
and
so
they
're
supermen
.

Pierpont
Morgan
has
never
said
'
I
'
in
his
life
.
"


Leonard
roused
himself
.

If
his
benefactress
wanted
intellectual
conversation
,
she
must
have
it
.

She
was
more
important
than
his
ruined
past
.

"
I
never
got
on
to
Nietzsche
,
"
he
said
.

"
But
I
always
understood
that
those
supermen
were
rather
what
you
may
call
egoists
.
"


"
Oh
,
no
,
that
's
wrong
,
"
replied
Helen
.

"
No
superman
ever
said
'
I
want
,
'
because
'
I
want
'
must
lead
to
the
question
,
'
Who
am
I
?
'
and
so
to
Pity
and
to
Justice
.

He
only
says
'
want
.
'

'
Want
Europe
,
'
if
he
's
Napoleon
;
'
want
wives
,
'
if
he
's
Bluebeard
;
'
want
Botticelli
,
'
if
he
's
Pierpont
Morgan
.

Never
the
'
I
'
;
and
if
you
could
pierce
through
him
,
you
'd
find
panic
and
emptiness
in
the
middle
.
"


"
I
do
n't
want
your
patronage
.

I
do
n't
want
your
tea
.

I
was
quite
happy
.

What
do
you
want
to
unsettle
me
for
?
"

He
turned
to
Mr.
Wilcox
.

"
I
put
it
to
this
gentleman
.

I
ask
you
,
sir
,
am
to
have
my
brain
picked
?
"


Mr.
Wilcox
turned
to
Margaret
with
the
air
of
humorous
strength
that
he
could
so
well
command
.

"
Are
we
intruding
,
Miss
Schlegel
?

Can
we
be
of
any
use
or
shall
we
go
?
"


But
Margaret
ignored
him
.


"
I
'm
connected
with
a
leading
insurance
company
,
sir
.

I
receive
what
I
take
to
be
an
invitation
from
these
—
ladies
"
(
he
drawled
the
word
)
.

"
I
come
,
and
it
's
to
have
my
brain
picked
.

I
ask
you
,
is
it
fair
?
"


"
Highly
unfair
,
"
said
Mr.
Wilcox
,
drawing
a
gasp
from
Evie
,
who
knew
that
her
father
was
becoming
dangerous
.


"
There
,
you
hear
that
?

Most
unfair
,
the
gentleman
says
.

There
!

Not
content
with
"
—
pointing
at
Margaret
—"
you
ca
n't
deny
it
.
"

His
voice
rose
:
he
was
falling
into
the
rhythm
of
a
scene
with
Jacky
.

"
But
as
soon
as
I
'm
useful
it
's
a
very
different
thing
.

'
Oh
yes
,
send
for
him
.

Cross
-
question
him
.

Pick
his
brains
.
'

Oh
yes
.

Now
,
take
me
on
the
whole
,
I
'm
a
quiet
fellow
:

I
'm
law
-
abiding
,
I
do
n't
wish
any
unpleasantness
;
but
I
—I
—
"


"
You
,

said
Margaret
—
"
you
—
you
—
"


Laughter
from
Evie
,
as
at
a
repartee
.


"
You
are
the
man
who
tried
to
walk
by
the
Pole
Star
.
"


More
laughter
.


"
You
saw
the
sunrise
.
"


Laughter
.


"
You
tried
to
get
away
from
the
fogs
that
are
stifling
us
all
—
away
past
books
and
houses
to
the
truth
.

You
were
looking
for
a
real
home
.
"


"
I
fail
to
see
the
connection
,
"
said
Leonard
,
hot
with
stupid
anger
.


"
So
do
I
.
"

There
was
a
pause
.

"
You
were
that
last
Sunday
—
you
are
this
today
.

Mr.
Bast
!

I
and
my
sister
have
talked
you
over
.

We
wanted
to
help
you
;
we
also
supposed
you
might
help
us
.

We
did
not
have
you
here
out
of
charity
—
which
bores
us
—
but
because
we
hoped
there
would
be
a
connection
between
last
Sunday
and
other
days
.

What
is
the
good
of
your
stars
and
trees
,
your
sunrise
and
the
wind
,
if
they
do
not
enter
into
our
daily
lives
?

They
have
never
entered
into
mine
,
but
into
yours
,
we
thought
—
Have
n't
we
all
to
struggle
against
life
's
daily
greyness
,
against
pettiness
,
against
mechanical
cheerfulness
,
against
suspicion
?

I
struggle
by
remembering
my
friends
;
others
I
have
known
by
remembering
some
place
—
some
beloved
place
or
tree
—
we
thought
you
one
of
these
.
