I
was
invalided
and
sent
to
Calcutta
,
where
the
best
surgical
help
was
at
my
disposal
.

To
all
appearance
,
the
wound
healed
there
—
then
broke
out
again
.

Twice
this
happened
;
and
the
medical
men
agreed
that
the
best
course
to
take
would
be
to
send
me
home
.

They
calculated
on
the
invigorating
effect
of
the
sea
voyage
,
and
,
failing
this
,
on
the
salutary
influence
of
my
native
air
.

In
the
Indian
climate
I
was
pronounced
incurable
.


Two
days
before
the
ship
sailed
a
letter
from
my
mother
brought
me
startling
news
.

My
life
to
come
—
if

I
had
a
life
to
come
—
had
been
turned
into
a
new
channel
.

Mr.
Germaine
had
died
suddenly
,
of
heart
-
disease
.

His
will
,
bearing
date
at
the
time
when
I
left
England
,
bequeathed
an
income
for
life
to
my
mother
,
and
left
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
me
,
on
the
one
condition
that
I
adopted
his
name
.

I
accepted
the
condition
,
of
course
,
and
became
George
Germaine
.


Three
months
later
,
my
mother
and
I
were
restored
to
each
other
.


Except
that
I
still
had
some
trouble
with
my
wound
,
behold
me
now
to
all
appearance
one
of
the
most
enviable
of
existing
mortals
;
promoted
to
the
position
of
a
wealthy
gentleman
;
possessor
of
a
house
in
London
and
of
a
country
-
seat
in
Perthshire
;
and
,
nevertheless
,
at
twenty
-
three
years
of
age
,
one
of
the
most
miserable
men
living
!


And
Mary
?


In
the
ten
years
that
had
now
passed
over
,
what
had
become
of
Mary
?


You
have
heard
my
story
.

Read
the
few
pages
that
follow
,
and
you
will
hear
hers
.


WHAT
I
have
now
to
tell
you
of
Mary
is
derived
from
information
obtained
at
a
date
in
my
life
later
by
many
years
than
any
date
of
which
I
have
written
yet
.

Be
pleased
to
remember
this
.


Dermody
,
the
bailiff
,
possessed
relatives
in
London
,
of
whom
he
occasionally
spoke
,
and
relatives
in
Scotland
,
whom
he
never
mentioned
.

My
father
had
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
Scotch
nation
.

Dermody
knew
his
master
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
the
prejudice
might
extend
to
him
,
if
he
spoke
of
his
Scotch
kindred
.

He
was
a
discreet
man
,
and
he
never
mentioned
them
.


On
leaving
my
father
’s
service
,
he
had
made
his
way
,
partly
by
land
and
partly
by
sea
,
to
Glasgow
—
in
which
city
his
friends
resided
.

With
his
character
and
his
experience
,
Dermody
was
a
man
in
a
thousand
to
any
master
who
was
lucky
enough
to
discover
him
.

His
friends
bestirred
themselves
.

In
six
weeks
’
time
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
a
gentleman
’s
estate
on
the
eastern
coast
of
Scotland
,
and
was
comfortably
established
with
his
mother
and
his
daughter
in
a
new
home
.


“
No
,
sir
.
”


“
Have
any
visitors
called
?
”


“
One
visitor
has
called
,
sir
.
”


“
Do
you
know
who
it
was
?
”


The
porter
mentioned
the
name
of
a
celebrated
physician
—a
man
at
the
head
of
his
profession
in
those
days
.

I
instantly
took
my
hat
and
went
to
his
house
.


He
had
just
returned
from
his
round
of
visits
.

My
card
was
taken
to
him
,
and
was
followed
at
once
by
my
admission
to
his
consulting
-
room
.


“
You
have
seen
my
mother
,
”
I
said
.

“
Is
she
seriously
ill
?

and
have
you
not
concealed
it
from
her
?

For
God
’s
sake
,
tell
me
the
truth
;
I
can
bear
it
.
”


The
great
man
took
me
kindly
by
the
hand
.


“
Your
mother
stands
in
no
need
of
any
warning
;
she
is
herself
aware
of
the
critical
state
of
her
health
,
”
he
said
.

“
She
sent
for
me
to
confirm
her
own
conviction
.

I
could
not
conceal
from
her
—I
must
not
conceal
from
you
—
that
the
vital
energies
are
sinking
.

She
may
live
for
some
months
longer
in
a
milder
air
than
the
air
of
London
.

That
is
all
I
can
say
.

At
her
age
,
her
days
are
numbered
.
”


He
gave
me
time
to
steady
myself
under
the
blow
;
and
then
he
placed
his
vast
experience
,
his
matured
and
consummate
knowledge
,
at
my
disposal
.

From
his
dictation
,
I
committed
to
writing
the
necessary
instructions
for
watching
over
the
frail
tenure
of
my
mother
’s
life
.


“
Let
me
give
you
one
word
of
warning
,
”
he
said
,
as
we
parted
.

“
Your
mother
is
especially
desirous
that
you
should
know
nothing
of
the
precarious
condition
of
her
health
.

Her
one
anxiety
is
to
see
you
happy
.

If
she
discovers
your
visit
to
me
,
I
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
.

Make
the
best
excuse
you
can
think
of
for
at
once
taking
her
away
from
London
,
and
,
whatever
you
may
feel
in
secret
,
keep
up
an
appearance
of
good
spirits
in
her
presence
.
”


That
evening
I
made
my
excuse
.

It
was
easily
found
.

I
had
only
to
tell
my
poor
mother
of
Mrs.
Van
Brandt
’s
refusal
to
marry
me
,
and
there
was
an
intelligible
motive
assigned
for
my
proposing
to
leave
London
.

The
same
night
I
wrote
to
inform
Mrs.
Van
Brandt
of
the
sad
event
which
was
the
cause
of
my
sudden
departure
,
and
to
warn
her
that
there
no
longer
existed
the
slightest
necessity
for
insuring
her
life
.

“
My
lawyers
”
(
I
wrote
)
“
have
undertaken
to
arrange
Mr.
Van
Brandt
’s
affairs
immediately
.

In
a
few
hours
he
will
be
at
liberty
to
accept
the
situation
that
has
been
offered
to
him
.
”

The
last
lines
of
the
letter
assured
her
of
my
unalterable
love
,
and
entreated
her
to
write
to
me
before
she
left
England
.


With
a
heavy
heart
I
looked
round
me
.

The
old
furniture
—
renewed
,
perhaps
,
in
one
or
two
places
—
asserted
its
mute
claim
to
my
recognition
in
every
part
of
the
room
.

The
tender
moonlight
streamed
slanting
into
the
corner
in
which
Mary
and
I
used
to
nestle
together
while
Dame
Dermody
was
at
the
window
reading
her
mystic
books
.

Overshadowed
by
the
obscurity
in
the
opposite
corner
,
I
discovered
the
high
-
backed
arm
-
chair
of
carved
wood
in
which
the
Sibyl
of
the
cottage
sat
on
the
memorable
day
when
she
warned
us
of
our
coming
separation
,
and
gave
us
her
blessing
for
the
last
time
.

Looking
next
round
the
walls
of
the
room
,
I
recognized
old
friends
wherever
my
eyes
happened
to
rest
—
the
gaudily
colored
prints
;
the
framed
pictures
in
fine
needle
-
work
,
which
we
thought
wonderful
efforts
of
art
;
the
old
circular
mirror
to
which
I
used
to
lift
Mary
when
she
wanted
“
to
see
her
face
in
the
glass
.
”

Whenever
the
moonlight
penetrated
there
,
it
showed
me
some
familiar
object
that
recalled
my
happiest
days
.

Again
the
by
-
gone
time
looked
back
in
mockery
.

Again
the
voices
of
the
past
came
to
me
with
their
burden
of
reproach
:

See
what
your
life
was
once
!

Is
your
life
worth
living
now
?


I
sat
down
at
the
window
,
where
I
could
just
discover
,
here
and
there
between
the
trees
,
the
glimmer
of
the
waters
of
the
lake
.

I
thought
to
myself
:

“
Thus
far
my
mortal
journey
has
brought
me
.

Why
not
end
it
here
?
”


Who
would
grieve
for
me
if
my
death
were
reported
to
-
morrow
?

Of
all
living
men
,
I
had
perhaps
the
smallest
number
of
friends
,
the
fewest
duties
to
perform
toward
others
,
the
least
reason
to
hesitate
at
leaving
a
world
which
had
no
place
in
it
for
my
ambition
,
no
creature
in
it
for
my
love
.


Besides
,
what
necessity
was
there
for
letting
it
be
known
that
my
death
was
a
death
of
my
own
seeking
?

It
could
easily
be
left
to
represent
itself
as
a
death
by
accident
.


On
that
fine
summer
night
,
and
after
a
long
day
of
traveling
,
might
I
not
naturally
take
a
bath
in
the
cool
water
before
I
went
to
bed
?

And
,
practiced
as
I
was
in
the
exercise
of
swimming
,
might
it
not
nevertheless
be
my
misfortune
to
be
attacked
by
cramp
?

On
the
lonely
shores
of
Greenwater
Broad
the
cry
of
a
drowning
man
would
bring
no
help
at
night
.

The
fatal
accident
would
explain
itself
.

There
was
literally
but
one
difficulty
in
the
way
—
the
difficulty
which
had
already
occurred
to
my
mind
.

Could
I
sufficiently
master
the
animal
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
to
deliberately
let
myself
sink
at
the
first
plunge
?


“
For
your
own
sake
”
(
the
letter
ran
)
“
make
no
attempt
to
see
me
,
and
take
no
notice
of
an
invitation
which
I
fear
you
will
receive
with
this
note
.

I
am
living
a
degraded
life
.

I
have
sunk
beneath
your
notice
.

You
owe
it
to
yourself
,
sir
,
to
forget
the
miserable
woman
who
now
writes
to
you
for
the
last
time
,
and
bids
you
gratefully
a
last
farewell
.
”


Those
sad
lines
were
signed
in
initials
only
.

It
is
needless
to
say
that
they
merely
strengthened
my
resolution
to
see
her
at
all
hazards
.

I
kissed
the
paper
on
which
her
hand
had
rested
,
and
then
I
turned
to
the
second
letter
.

It
contained
the
“
invitation
”
to
which
my
correspondent
had
alluded
,
and
it
was
expressed
in
these
terms
:


“
Mr.
Van
Brandt
presents
his
compliments
to
Mr.
Germaine
,
and
begs
to
apologize
for
the
somewhat
abrupt
manner
in
which
he
received
Mr.
Germaine
’s
polite
advances
.

Mr.
Van
Brandt
suffers
habitually
from
nervous
irritability
,
and
he
felt
particularly
ill
last
night
.

He
trusts
Mr.
Germaine
will
receive
this
candid
explanation
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
offered
;
and
he
begs
to
add
that
Mrs.
Van
Brandt
will
be
delighted
to
receive
Mr.
Germaine
whenever
he
may
find
it
convenient
to
favor
her
with
a
visit
.
”


That
Mr.
Van
Brandt
had
some
sordid
interest
of
his
own
to
serve
in
writing
this
grotesquely
impudent
composition
,
and
that
the
unhappy
woman
who
bore
his
name
was
heartily
ashamed
of
the
proceeding
on
which
he
had
ventured
,
were
conclusions
easily
drawn
after
reading
the
two
letters
.

The
suspicion
of
the
man
and
of
his
motives
which
I
naturally
felt
produced
no
hesitation
in
my
mind
as
to
the
course
which
I
had
determined
to
pursue
.

On
the
contrary
,
I
rejoiced
that
my
way
to
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Van
Brandt
was
smoothed
,
no
matter
with
what
motives
,
by
Mr.
Van
Brandt
himself
.


I
waited
at
home
until
noon
,
and
then
I
could
wait
no
longer
.

Leaving
a
message
of
excuse
for
my
mother
(
I
had
just
sense
of
shame
enough
left
to
shrink
from
facing
her
)
,
I
hastened
away
to
profit
by
my
invitation
on
the
very
day
when
I
received
it
.


As
I
lifted
my
hand
to
ring
the
house
bell
,
the
door
was
opened
from
within
,
and
no
less
a
person
than
Mr.
Van
Brandt
himself
stood
before
me
.

He
had
his
hat
on
.

We
had
evidently
met
just
as
he
was
going
out
.


I
too
looked
at
Elfie
.

Might
she
not
,
I
asked
myself
,
be
made
the
innocent
means
of
forcing
her
mother
to
leave
the
house
?

Trusting
to
the
child
’s
fearless
character
,
and
her
eagerness
to
see
the
boat
,
I
suddenly
opened
the
door
.

As
I
had
anticipated
,
she
instantly
ran
out
.

The
second
door
,
leading
into
the
square
,
I
had
not
closed
when
I
entered
the
courtyard
.

In
another
moment
Elfie
was
out
in
the
square
,
triumphing
in
her
freedom
.

The
shrill
little
voice
broke
the
death
-
like
stillness
of
the
place
and
hour
,
calling
to
me
again
and
again
to
take
her
to
the
boat
.


I
turned
to
Mrs.
Van
Brandt
.

The
stratagem
had
succeeded
.

Elfie
’s
mother
could
hardly
refuse
to
follow
when
Elfie
led
the
way
.


“
Will
you
go
with
us
?
”

I
asked
.

“
Or
must
I
send
the
money
back
by
the
child
?
”


Her
eyes
rested
on
me
for
a
moment
with
a
deepening
expression
of
distrust
,
then
looked
away
again
.

She
began
to
turn
pale
.

“
You
are
not
like
yourself
to
-
night
,
”
she
said
.

Without
a
word
more
,
she
took
her
hat
and
cloak
and
went
out
before
me
into
the
square
.

I
followed
her
,
closing
the
doors
behind
me
.

She
made
an
attempt
to
induce
the
child
to
approach
her
.

“
Come
,
darling
,
”
she
said
,
enticingly
—“
come
and
take
my
hand
.
”


But
Elfie
was
not
to
be
caught
:
she
took
to
her
heels
,
and
answered
from
a
safe
distance
.

“
No
,
”
said
the
child
;
“
you
will
take
me
back
and
put
me
to
bed
.
”

She
retreated
a
little
further
,
and
held
up
the
key
:
“
I
shall
go
first
,
”
she
cried
,
“
and
open
the
door
.
”


She
trotted
off
a
few
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
harbor
,
and
waited
for
what
was
to
happen
next
.

Her
mother
suddenly
turned
,
and
looked
close
at
me
under
the
light
of
the
stars
.


“
Are
the
sailors
on
board
the
boat
?
”
she
asked
.


The
question
startled
me
.

Had
she
any
suspicion
of
my
purpose
?

Had
my
face
warned
her
of
lurking
danger
if
she
went
to
the
boat
?

It
was
impossible
.

The
more
likely
motive
for
her
inquiry
was
to
find
a
new
excuse
for
not
accompanying
me
to
the
harbor
.

If
I
told
her
that
the
men
were
on
board
,
she
might
answer
,
“
Why
not
employ
one
of
your
sailors
to
bring
the
money
to
me
at
the
house
?
”

I
took
care
to
anticipate
the
suggestion
in
making
my
reply
.
