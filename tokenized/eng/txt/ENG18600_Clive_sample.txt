At
this
moment
,
however
,
her
wishes
were
all
limited
to
rest
,
and
gladly
did
she
sink
upon
the
seat
at
which
Leslie
prevailed
on
Laura
to
stop
;
but
Laura
was
so
restless
,
that
Leslie
at
last
started
up
with
a
new
project
in
his
head
,
and
proposed
that
they
two
alone
should
make
for
the
point
at
which
Laura
had
intended
to
reach
,
and
should
leave
their
companion
to
enjoy
a
little
repose
before
they
returned
for
her
to
go
home
.


“
Unless
you
are
afraid
,
”
said
Laura
,
turning
round
on
Elinor
.


“
No
,
I
am
not
afraid
,
for
you
say
there
is
no
danger
,
”
said
Elinor
.


And
now
Leslie
hurried
his
companion
away
,
and
pushing
himself
into
the
highest
spirits
,
rallied
her
on
her
activity
,
her
delightful
health
and
strength
,
till
Laura
,
quite
deceived
,
quickened
her
pace
to
the
very
utmost
,
and
went
over
hill
and
dale
at
his
side
,
with
no
idea
but
that
of
keeping
up
the
contrast
between
herself
and
the
timid
Elinor
.


It
was
not
till
he
had
carried
her
along
with
him
to
a
point
much
nearer
to
the
house
than
to
Elinor
,
that
he
suddenly
affected
to
remember
their
charge
.


“
Meantime
,
what
have
we
done
with
your
ward
,
your
nursling
?

Is
not
it
time
to
go
back
for
her
?
”


He
was
well
aware
at
this
moment
that
Laura
was
most
thoroughly
wearied
herself
,
and
that
by
a
little
contrivance
he
was
secure
of
going
alone
to
conduct
the
young
nun
home
again
.


“
What
!

had
you
forgotten
her
?
”
said
Laura
.


“
Could
I
think
of
more
than
one
?
”
said
Leslie
,
with
a
look
of
gentleness
.


“
And
that
one
was
of
course
absent
,
”
said
Laura
.


“
Ah
!

I
see
,
”
said
Leslie
,
affecting
a
little
pique
,
“
that
I
am
little
understood
.

But
at
this
moment
,
”
he
added
,
quieting
his
voice
,
“
however
that
may
be
,
we
must
run
back
to
take
up
our
charge
,
for
do
you
know
what
o’clock
it
is
?
”


Laura
looked
at
her
watch
.


“
Why
did
you
allow
me
to
forget
time
in
this
way
?
”
said
she
.


“
Was
I
likely
to
remind
you
?
”
said
Leslie
.

“
But
at
all
events
I
will
repair
my
error
,
at
whatever
sacrifice
.

I
will
force
myself
”
—“
from
you
,
”
he
thought
of
saying
,
but
that
was
rather
too
strong
an
expression
to
come
easily
,
so
he
began
again—
“
I
will
force
myself
through
the
world
of
briars
by
the
brook
side
,
which
will
take
me
back
to
Miss
Ladylift
more
quickly
than
the
path
we
have
followed
,
and
I
will
bring
her
to
join
you
by
the
garden
road
,
which
is
,
I
suppose
,
the
nearest
way
to
the
house
.

Even
your
delightful
intrepidity
would
shrink
from
the
brook
side
,
and
,
indeed
,
should
it
be
otherwise
,
I
would
not
permit
you
to
hazard
yourself
so
perilously
.
”


“
You
can
if
you
will
,
”
said
he
;
“
every
‐
body
can
judge
themselves
as
well
as
they
can
judge
other
people
,
if
they
will
be
honest
to
themselves
.

And
it
is
not
being
honest
,
to
think
worse
of
oneself
than
is
the
truth
.
”


“
My
dear
Mother
told
me
my
voice
was
such
a
voice
as
hundreds
of
others
have
.
”


“
But
what
do
you
think
yourself
?
”


“
I
believe
her
,
”
said
Elinor
.


“
Yes
,
surely
,
”
answered
Leslie
,
afraid
of
alarming
his
companion
.

“
She
spoke
her
entire
conviction
,
no
doubt
;
still
she
judged
from
her
Convent
alone
.

There
,
perhaps
,
where
all
is
holy
,
all
dedicated
to
divine
things
,
the
inhabitants
may
be
blessed
,
many
of
them
,
with
gifts
like
the
one
you
have
in
your
voice
;
but
it
is
not
so
in
the
world
.

You
are
in
the
world
now
;
you
must
judge
by
what
you
see
and
hear
;
you
may
find
there
are
things
unlike
those
which
the
Reverend
Mother
knows
.
”


“
Oh
!

she
can
not
be
mistaken
,
”
said
Elinor
.


“
Only
ask
yourself
whether
she
is
,
”
said
Leslie
.

“
If
so
,
some
things
which
were
good
guides
in
the
convent
,
may
lead
wrong
here
.
”


Elinor
answered
nothing
.

The
first
doubt
of
the
kind
was
painful
,
the
more
so
because
her
honest
nature
saw
that
perhaps
it
was
true
.


After
a
pause
,
she
said
,
“
Who
can
I
trust
,
then
?
”


“
I
know
this
outer
world
,
”
said
Leslie
.


“
But
I
do
not
know
you
,
”
said
Elinor
;
“
I
know
nobody
.

I
will
do
my
best
;
you
must
not
try
to
prevent
me
.

If
you
liked
my
singing
,
I
am
glad
of
that
;
but
perhaps
you
do
not
understand
music
,
and
then
you
can
not
judge
.
”


“
No
,
perhaps
I
do
not
,
”
said
Leslie
;
“
you
know
I
can
only
say
what
I
honestly
feel
.
”


“
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!

I
know
you
do
that
.

Everybody
does
that
,
”
said
Elinor
,
speaking
as
she
had
been
unconsciously
taught
,
and
as
she
felt
,
that
though
there
were
wicked
people
in
the
world
,
nobody
with
whom
one
associates
could
be
in
the
number
of
those
wicked
.


Mr.
Leslie
abhorred
Laura
for
coming
up
and
interrupting
the
conversation
.

She
said
she
was
sorry
to
see
Elinor
look
so
pale
;
no
doubt
she
was
used
to
very
early
hours
in
the
Convent
,
and
she
had
better
go
to
bed
.

She
did
not
say
she
thought
her
young
friend
tired
;
for
knowing
her
not
to
be
tired
,
she
felt
that
Elinor
would
say
No
.


And
thus
they
walked
,
by
the
hedgerow
sides
of
the
corn
fields
,
across
banky
meadows
cropped
by
sheep
,
along
woodland
paths
,
which
descended
to
the
brook
courses
;
where
they
were
crossed
by
gray
large
stepping
‐
stones
;
within
the
edges
of
the
wood
,
where
with
trees
for
a
natural
colonnade
,
they
looked
out
upon
the
silent
,
sunny
country
;
hand
in
hand
they
walked
,
healthy
,
beautiful
,
good
.

It
was
Adam
and
Eve
moving
through
the
Garden
of
Eden
.


They
had
scarcely
met
a
human
being
,
the
country
was
thinly
inhabited
,
and
they
had
unconsciously
sought
the
least
frequented
parts
;
but
some
hours
after
they
first
began
their
walk
,
the
forest
silence
was
disturbed
by
a
distant
voice
,
uttering
a
loud
“
mark
!
”

and
then
was
fired
a
gun
as
distant
,
and
before
long
both
sounds
came
nearer
;
nay
,
they
presently
saw
a
towering
pheasant
hit
by
the
discharge
from
the
loud
gun
,
and
tumbling
over
and
over
in
the
air
,
fall
with
hanging
wings
,
and
dropped
head
,
out
of
sight
in
the
underwood
.


The
next
moment
,
Sir
Peter
Bicester
,
and
a
gamekeeper
,
and
couple
of
beaters
came
in
view
;
he
immediately
left
off
his
pursuit
,
and
came
up
to
Elinor
,
hoping
he
had
not
frightened
her
,
and
so
on
.

Leslie
had
dropped
Elinor
’s
hand
;
till
she
was
declared
his
promised
wife
,
he
did
not
wish
to
claim
any
intimacy
with
her
;
but
Elinor
was
unconscious
of
such
scruples
,
and
replied
in
the
simplest
way
to
the
young
man
’s
apologies
.


“
But
we
are
going
home
now
,
”
she
said
,
“
so
do
not
stop
your
amusement
for
me
.

Thank
you
for
thinking
of
it
.
”

And
she
moved
on
.


“
Sha
n’t
you
come
out
,
Leslie
?
”
said
Sir
Peter
.


“
No
,
not
I
;
if
there
’s
anything
better
to
do
,
I
do
n’t
care
for
a
gun
.
”


“
And
there
is
something
it
seems
,
”
said
Sir
Peter
.


“
Well
!

that
is
as
it
may
be
,
”
answered
Leslie
,
and
followed
Elinor
,
whom
he
speedily
overtook
.


THAT
evening
,
Sir
Peter
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
cousin
’s
sitting
‐
room
,
when
he
came
in
an
hour
before
dinner
.


“
Have
you
got
some
tea
,
Laura
?
”

he
asked
;
“
let
me
have
a
cup
with
you
,
if
you
are
going
to
have
any
.
”


“
Come
in
,
come
in
!
”
said
Laura
,
ringing
the
bell
at
the
same
time
,
and
ordering
tea
for
him
and
her
.

“
Well
,
what
have
you
shot
?
”


“
Six
pheasants
,
and
a
woodcock
,
”
said
Sir
Peter
;
“
I
just
went
into
that
outside
cover
,
you
know
,
below
the
lime
kiln
.
”


“
Nobody
but
yourself
,
”
said
she
,
trying
to
lay
her
thumb
on
the
fastening
;
“
you
have
worried
it
in
turning
it
about
so
.
”


“
No
,
no
!
”
said
Leslie
,
guarding
it
from
her
,
for
though
he
had
only
asked
the
question
as
a
random
shot
,
he
now
was
certain
that
there
was
some
mystery
.


“
That
I
have
not
,
neither
shall
you
;
but
you
shall
tell
me
what
I
ask
,
for
I
have
you
in
my
power
,
and
I
will
know
.
”


The
old
sharpshooter
was
chased
from
her
defences
,
but
ran
and
took
up
another
position
.

“
Well
—
well
,
”
said
she
,
“
you
are
a
young
gentleman
,
and
a
mighty
good
‐
looking
,
and
if
I
were
you
,
I
should
not
take
it
amiss
that
the
ladies
thought
worth
while
escorting
my
letters
,
and
jealousing
what
was
writ
in
them
.

It
is
not
old
gentlemen
and
old
ladies
as
do
such
things
.
”


“
In
short
,
Miss
Chanson
has
had
this
letter
in
her
hands
before
me
.
”


“
Oh
!

dear
me
!
—
Miss
Chanson
!
—
no
,
dear
no
!

—I
never
said
no
such
thing
.
”


“
No
,
you
did
not
say
it
!
”
said
Leslie
.

“
I
perfectly
comprehend
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
that
lady
;
and
now
do
n’t
be
afraid
,
for
I
know
all
I
want
.

Good
evening
.
”


“
That
’s
a
wilful
man
,
”
said
the
post‐mistress
to
herself
,
“
and
those
be
two
silly
girls
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
.
”


Leslie
meantime
walked
hastily
away
,
and
took
a
path
over
the
fields
to
be
out
of
observation
,
opening
and
reading
the
much
canvassed
letter
as
he
went
along
.

He
could
not
but
smile
at
the
simplicity
of
the
writer
’s
alarms
,
and
of
her
confidence
in
him
.


“
Sir
,
(
”
that
’s
Monsieur
,
“
said
he
)
—


”
SI
R
—
You
are
my
only
friend
;
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
unless
you
can
help
me
—
and
you
told
me
to
ask
you
for
help
if
I
was
in
trouble
.

Have
you
money
you
can
lend
me
?

I
will
pay
you
back
,
a
little
every
quarter
,
and
once
you
said
it
was
not
wrong
to
borrow
from
you
.

Miss
Chanson
called
me
,
and
gave
me
many
bills
,
which
I
did
not
know
of
—
perhaps
they
will
put
me
in
prison
.

What
will
become
of
me
?


“
ELINOR
LADYLIFT
.
”


“
Poor
,
precious
,
enchanting
Elinor
!
”
cried
he
;
“
how
unkind
,
how
sententious
,
they
are
to
you
.

I
can
see
the
matter
from
here
;
ordinary
bills
are
thrust
into
your
hands
,
without
explanation
,
without
advice
,
and
your
conventual
imagination
sees
nothing
in
them
but
an
ogre
of
a
creditor
,
and
dungeons
and
chains
.

Oh
!

how
can
I
be
soonest
with
you
?

I
dare
not
come
at
once
,
for
even
your
innocence
would
disbelieve
that
I
was
as
far
off
as
I
ought
to
have
been
when
I
got
your
summons
.

Yet
—
summons
!

no
,
it
is
not
that
;
nothing
was
further
,
I
do
believe
,
from
your
thoughts
,
than
to
call
me
to
you
—
yet
,
poor
dove
,
you
have
done
so
,
and
when
such
fair
birds
are
no
better
looked
after
by
their
natural
guardians
,
what
is
indeed
to
become
of
them
?

Now
I
must
write
so
as
not
to
frighten
her
.
”


“
I
can
write
to
you
,
if
you
will
tell
me
your
direction
,
”
said
Elinor
.


“
Divine
Elinor
!
”
cried
Leslie
,
carried
away
with
delicious
surprise
;
and
suddenly
lifting
the
hand
he
held
to
his
lips
,
he
kissed
it
fervidly
,
so
that
in
astonishment
she
drew
it
away
,
and
a
smile
came
for
an
instant
over
her
mouth
.


Leslie
looked
down
at
her
with
delight
;
he
drew
still
nearer
to
her
,
when
the
sound
of
rustling
boughs
smote
his
ear
,
and
then
the
voice
of
the
Squire
—
of
Mr.
Chanson
,
of
Elinor
’s
guardian
—
broke
upon
them
.


“
Hey
!
—
what
’s
this
?

You
and
Miss
Ladylift
out
in
the
wood
,
here
?

”
—
he
was
not
a
man
of
words
.


Leslie
started
up
;
Elinor
kept
her
seat
.


“
Yes
;
I
came
this
way
to
enjoy
the
shade
,
and
Miss
Ladylift
had
done
the
same
.

I
met
with
her
a
moment
ago
,
and
was
about
to
show
her
the
nearest
way
home
.
”


Elinor
listened
with
wonder
.

She
thought
certainly
Leslie
had
forgotten
that
she
had
come
to
meet
him
near
the
lodge
,
and
that
they
had
spent
an
hour
in
walking
to
the
spot
together
,
without
any
reference
to
going
home
;
however
,
she
heard
him
as
children
hear
their
elders
say
things
they
have
themselves
been
taught
not
to
say
,
and
unconsciously
they
take
a
lesson
in
the
difference
between
learning
and
practising
.


Mr.
Chanson
asked
no
more
;
he
only
held
out
his
arm
to
her
,
and
said
,


“
Come
home
with
me
.

Laura
ought
to
have
been
with
you
.
”

He
had
a
fishing
‐
rod
in
the
other
hand
,
and
had
been
making
his
way
to
the
brook
.


“
Miss
Chanson
is
out
riding
,
”
said
Elinor
.


“
And
why
did
not
you
go
?

What
made
you
wander
to
this
out
‐
of
‐
the
‐
way
place
?
”


Elinor
hesitated
;
she
did
not
like
to
say
she
had
been
scolded
,
and
had
crept
away
.


Mr.
Chanson
thought
she
had
made
an
appointment
with
Leslie
,
and
that
her
embarrassment
came
from
that
consciousness
.


“
Well
,
well
!
”
said
he
.

“
Mr.
Leslie
,
you
had
better
look
after
your
horse
.

That
’s
your
best
way
home
—
along
the
green
path
,
there
.

I
’ll
take
her
over
the
brook
