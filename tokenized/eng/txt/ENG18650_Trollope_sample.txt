Lady
Macleod
shook
her
head
.

She
did
not
like
to
say
anything
against
Mr.
Vavasor
before
his
daughter
;
but
the
shaking
of
her
head
was
intended
to
signify
that
Mr.
Vavasor
's
assent
in
such
a
matter
was
worth
nothing
.


"
I
can
only
say
again
,
"
said
Lady
Macleod
,
"
that
I
think
Mr.
Grey
will
be
displeased
,
—
and
that
he
will
have
very
great
cause
for
displeasure
.

And
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
his
approbation
ought
to
be
your
chief
study
.

I
believe
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
ask
you
to
let
Jane
get
me
a
cab
.

I
sha
n't
have
a
bit
too
much
time
to
dress
for
the
concert
.
"


Alice
simply
rang
the
bell
,
and
said
no
further
word
on
the
subject
which
they
had
been
discussing
.

When
Lady
Macleod
got
up
to
go
away
,
Alice
kissed
her
,
as
was
customary
with
them
,
and
the
old
lady
as
she
went
uttered
her
customary
valediction
.

"
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
.

Good
-
bye
!

I
'll
come
to
-
morrow
if
I
can
.
"

There
was
therefore
no
quarrel
between
them
.

But
both
of
them
felt
that
words
had
been
spoken
which
must
probably
lead
to
some
diminution
of
their
past
intimacy
.


When
Lady
Macleod
had
gone
Alice
sat
alone
for
an
hour
thinking
of
what
had
passed
between
them
,—
thinking
rather
of
those
two
men
,
the
worthy
man
and
the
wild
man
,
whose
names
had
been
mentioned
in
close
connection
with
herself
.

John

Grey
was
a
worthy
man
,
a
man
worthy
at
all
points
,
as
far
as
she
knew
him
.

She
told
herself
it
was
so
.

And
she
told
herself
,
also
,
that
her
cousin
George
was
wild
,
—
very
wild
.

And
yet
her
thoughts
were
,
I
fear
,
on
the
whole
more
kindly
towards
her
cousin
than
towards
her
lover
.

She
had
declared
to
her
aunt
that
John
Grey
would
be
incapable
of
such
suspicion
as
would
be
shown
by
any
objection
on
his
part
to
the
arrangements
made
for
the
tour
.

She
had
said
so
,
and
had
so
believed
;
and
yet
she
continued
to
brood
over
the
position
which
her
affairs
would
take
,
if
he
did
make
the
objection
which
Lady
Macleod
anticipated
.

She
told
herself
over
and
over
again
,
that
under
such
circumstances
she
would
not
give
way
an
inch
.

"
He
is
free
to
go
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.

"
If
he
does
not
trust
me
he
is
quite
free
to
go
.
"

It
may
almost
be
said
that
she
came
at
last
to
anticipate
from
her
lover
that
very
answer
to
her
own
letter
which
she
had
declared
him
to
be
incapable
of
making
.


"
Say
all
what
?
"


"
You
know
I
confessed
that
I
had
been
very
bad
in
not
coming
to
you
in
London
last
year
.
"


"
I
never
thought
of
it
for
a
moment
.
"


"
You
did
not
care
whether
I
came
or
not
:
was
that
it
?

But
never
mind
.

Why
should
you
have
cared
?

But
I
cared
.

I
told
you
in
my
letter
that
I
did
n't
come
because
I
had
so
many
things
on
hand
.

Of
course
that
was
a
fib
.
"


"
Everybody
makes
excuses
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Alice
.


"
But
they
do
n't
make
them
to
the
very
people
of
all
others
whom
they
want
to
know
and
love
.

I
was
longing
to
come
to
you
every
day
.

But
I
feared
I
could
not
come
without
speaking
of
him
;
—
and
I
had
determined
never
to
speak
of
him
again
.
"

This
she
said
in
that
peculiar
low
voice
which
she
assumed
at
times
.


"
Then
why
do
it
now
,
Lady
Glencora
?
"


"
I
wo
n't
be
called
Lady
Glencora
.

Call
me
Cora
.

I
had
a
sister
once
,
older
than
I
,
and
she
used
to
call
me
Cora
.

If
she
had
lived
—
.

But
never
mind
that
now
.

She
did
n't
live
.

I
'll
tell
you
why
I
do
it
now
.

Because
I
can
not
help
it
.

Besides
,
I
've
met
him
.

I
've
been
in
the
same
room
with
him
,
and
have
spoken
to
him
.

What
's
the
good
of
any
such
resolution
now
?
"


"
And
you
have
met
him
?
"


"
Yes
;
he
—
Mr
.

Palliser
—
knew
all
about
it
.

When
he
talked
of
taking
me
to
the
house
,
I
whispered
to
him
that
I
thought
Burgo
would
be
there
.
"


"
Do
not
call
him
by
his
Christian
name
,
"
said
Alice
,
almost
with
a
shudder
.


"
Why
not
?

—
why
not
his
Christian
name
?

I
did
when
I
told
my
husband
.

Or
perhaps
I
said
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
"


"
Well
.
"


"
And
he
bade
me
go
.

He
said
it
did
n't
signify
,
and
that
I
had
better
learn
to
bear
it
.

Bear
it
,
indeed
!

If
I
am
to
meet
him
,
and
speak
to
him
,
and
look
at
him
,
surely
I
may
mention
his
name
.
"

And
then
she
paused
for
an
answer
.

"
May
I
not
?
"


"
What
am
I
to
say
?
"
exclaimed
Alice
.


"
Anything
you
please
,
that
's
not
a
falsehood
.

But
I
've
got
you
here
because
I
do
n't
think
you
will
tell
a
falsehood
.

Oh
,
Alice
,
I
do
so
want
to
go
right
,
and
it
is
so
hard
!
"


Hard
,
indeed
,
poor
creature
,
for
one
so
weighted
as
she
had
been
,
and
sent
out
into
the
world
with
so
small
advantages
of
previous
training
or
of
present
friendship
!

Alice
began
to
feel
now
that
she
had
been
enticed
to
Matching
Priory
because
her
cousin
wanted
a
friend
,
and
of
course
she
could
not
refuse
to
give
the
friendship
that
was
asked
from
her
.

She
got
up
from
her
chair
,
and
kneeling
down
at
the
other
's
feet
put
up
her
face
and
kissed
her
.


"
Yes
,
I
have
seen
him
.

I
was
in
London
the
day
you
left
.
"


"
It
is
so
terrible
to
think
that
I
should
have
brought
upon
you
all
this
trouble
.
"


"
You
will
bring
upon
me
much
worse
trouble
than
that
unless
—
.

But
I
have
not
now
come
down
here
to
tell
you
that
.

I
believe
that
according
to
rule
in
such
matters
I
should
not
have
come
to
you
at
all
,
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
care
much
about
such
rules
.
"


"
It
is
I
that
have
broken
all
rules
.
"


"
When
a
lady
tells
a
gentleman
that
she
does
not
wish
to
see
more
of
him
—
"


"
Oh
,
Mr.
Grey
,
I
have
not
told
you
that
.
"


"
Have
you
not
?

I
am
glad
at
any
rate
to
hear
you
deny
it
.

But
you
will
understand
what
I
mean
.

When
a
gentleman
gets
his
dismissal
from
a
lady
he
should
accept
it
,—
that
is
,
his
dismissal
under
such
circumstances
as
I
have
received
mine
.

But
I
can
not
lay
down
my
love
in
that
way
;
nor
,
maintaining
my
love
,
can
I
give
up
the
battle
.

It
seems
to
me
that
I
have
a
right
at
any
rate
to
know
something
of
your
comings
and
goings
as
long
as
,—
unless
,
Alice
,
you
should
take
another
name
than
mine
.
"


"
My
intention
is
to
keep
my
own
.
"

This
she
said
in
the
lowest
possible
tone
,
—
almost
in
a
whisper
,—
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
.


"
And
you
will
not
deny
me
that
right
?
"


"
I
can
not
hinder
you
.

Whatever
you
may
do
,
I
myself
have
sinned
so
against
you
that
I
can
have
no
right
to
blame
you
.
"


"
There
shall
be
no
question
between
us
of
injury
from
one
to
the
other
.

In
any
conversation
that
we
may
have
,
or
in
any
correspondence
—
"


"
Oh
,
Mr.
Grey
,
do
not
ask
me
to
write
.
"


"
Listen
to
me
.

Should
there
be
any
on
either
side
,
there
shall
be
no
idea
of
any
wrong
done
.
"


"
But
I
have
done
you
wrong
;
—
great
wrong
.
"


"
No
,
Alice
;
I
will
not
have
it
so
.

When
I
asked
you
to
accept
my
hand
,
—
begging
the
greatest
boon
which
it
could
ever
come
to
my
lot
to
ask
from
a
fellow
-
mortal
,—
I
knew
well
how
great
was
your
goodness
to
me
when
you
told
me
that
it
should
be
mine
.

Now
that
you
refuse
it
,
I
know
also
that
you
are
good
,
thinking
that
in
doing
so
you
are
acting
for
my
welfare
,—
thinking
more
of
my
welfare
than
of
your
own
.
"


"
Nothing
,
"
said
Alice
.


"
Then
why
am
I
tabooed
?

Why
was
I
told
the
other
day
that
I
might
not
congratulate
you
on
your
happy
emancipation
?

I
say
boldly
,
that
had
you
resolved
on
that
while
we
were
together
in
Switzerland
,
you
would
have
permitted
me
,
as
a
friend
,
almost
as
a
brother
,
to
discuss
it
with
you
.
"


"
I
think
not
,
George
.
"


"
I
am
sure
you
would
.

And
why
has
Kate
been
warned
not
to
tell
me
of
this
visit
to
the
Pallisers
?

I
know
she
has
been
warned
though
she
has
not
confessed
it
.
"


Alice
sat
silent
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
in
answer
to
this
charge
brought
against
her
,—
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
the
questioner
would
allow
his
question
to
pass
without
an
answer
.

But
Vavasor
was
not
so
complaisant
.

"
If
there
be
any
reason
,
Alice
,
I
think
that
I
have
a
right
to
ask
it
.
"


For
a
few
seconds
she
did
not
speak
a
word
,
but
sat
considering
.

He
also
remained
silent
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
.

She
looked
at
him
and
saw
nothing
but
his
scar
,
—
nothing
but
his
scar
and
the
brightness
of
his
eyes
,
which
was
almost
fierce
.

She
knew
that
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
therefore
resolved
that
she
would
be
in
earnest
also
.

"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
"
she
said
at
last
.


"
Then
let
me
exercise
it
.
"


"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
but
I
think
also
that
you
are
ungenerous
to
exercise
it
.
"


"
I
can
not
understand
that
.

By
heavens
,
Alice
,
I
can
not
be
left
in
this
suspense
!

If
I
have
done
anything
to
offend
you
,
perhaps
I
can
remove
the
offence
by
apology
.
"


"
You
have
done
nothing
to
offend
me
.
"


"
Or
if
there
be
any
cause
why
our
friendship
should
be
dropped
,
—
why
we
should
be
on
a
different
footing
to
each
other
in
London
than
we
were
in
Switzerland
,
I
may
acknowledge
it
,
if
it
be
explained
to
me
.

But
I
can
not
put
up
with
the
doubt
,
when
I
am
told
that
I
have
a
right
to
demand
its
solution
.
"


"
Then
I
will
be
frank
with
you
,
George
,
though
my
being
so
will
,
as
you
may
guess
,
be
very
painful
.
"

She
paused
again
,
looking
at
him
to
see
if
yet
he
would
spare
her
;
but
he
was
all
scar
and
eyes
as
before
,
and
there
was
no
mercy
in
his
face
.


"
Your
sister
,
George
,
has
thought
that
my
parting
with
Mr.
Grey
might
lead
to
a
renewal
of
a
purpose
of
marriage
between
you
and
me
.

You
know
her
eagerness
,
and
will
understand
that
it
may
have
been
necessary
that
I
should
require
silence
from
her
on
that
head
.

You
ought
now
to
understand
it
all
.
"


Cheesacre
,
too
,
had
adopted
something
of
a
sailor
's
garb
.

He
had
on
a
jacket
of
a
rougher
sort
,
coming
down
much
lower
than
that
of
the
captain
,
being
much
looser
,
and
perhaps
somewhat
more
like
a
garment
which
a
possible
seaman
might
possibly
wear
.

But
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
the
moment
that
he
saw
Bellfield
.

His
heart
had
been
faint
,
and
he
had
not
dared
to
ornament
himself
boldly
as
his
friend
had
done
.

"
I
say
,
Guss
,
you
are
a
swell
,
"
he
exclaimed
.

It
may
be
explained
that
Captain
Bellfield
had
been
christened
Gustavus
.


"
I
do
n't
know
much
about
that
,
"
said
the
captain
;
"
my
fellow
sent
me
this
toggery
,
and
said
that
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
.

I
'll
change
with
you
if
you
like
it
.
"

But
Cheesacre
could
not
have
worn
that
jacket
,
and
he
walked
on
,
hating
himself
.


It
will
be
remembered
that
Mrs.
Greenow
had
spoken
with
considerable
severity
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
pretensions
when
discussing
his
character
with
her
niece
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
on
the
present
occasion
she
received
him
with
most
gracious
smiles
.

It
may
be
that
her
estimate
of
his
character
had
been
altered
,
or
that
she
was
making
sacrifice
of
her
own
feelings
in
consideration
of
Mr.

Cheesacre
,
who
was
known
to
be
the
captain
's
intimate
friend
.

But
she
had
smiles
for
both
of
them
.

She
had
a
wondrous
power
of
smiling
;
and
could
,
upon
occasion
,
give
signs
of
peculiar
favour
to
half
a
dozen
different
gentlemen
in
as
many
minutes
.

They
found
her
in
the
midst
of
hampers
which
were
not
yet
wholly
packed
,
while
Mrs.
Jones
,
Jeannette
,
and
the
cook
of
the
household
moved
around
her
,
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
,
ministering
to
her
wants
.

She
had
in
her
hand
an
outspread
clean
napkin
,
and
she
wore
fastened
round
her
dress
a
huge
coarse
apron
,
that
she
might
thus
be
protected
from
some
possible
ebullition
of
gravy
,
or
escape
of
salad
mixture
,
or
cream
;
but
in
other
respects
she
was
clothed
in
the
fullest
honours
of
widowhood
.

She
had
not
mitigated
her
weeds
by
half
an
inch
.

She
had
scorned
to
make
any
compromise
between
the
world
of
pleasure
and
the
world
of
woe
.

There
she
was
,
a
widow
,
declared
by
herself
to
be
of
four
months
'
standing
,
with
a
buried
heart
,
making
ready
a
dainty
banquet
with
skill
and
liberality
.

She
was
ready
on
the
instant
to
sit
down
upon
the
baskets
in
which
the
grouse
pie
had
been
just
carefully
inhumed
,
and
talked
about
her
sainted
lamb
with
a
deluge
of
tears
.

If
anybody
did
n't
like
it
,
that
person
—
might
do
the
other
thing
.

Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
thought
that
they
did
like
it
.
