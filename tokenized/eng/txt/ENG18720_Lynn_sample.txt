“
I
thought
Joshua
would
find
her
out
in
time
,
”
was
Mary
's
comment
.

“
I
took
stock
of
her
from
the
first
,
and
saw
she
was
no
good
.
”


I
HAVE
said
so
much
of
the
personal
charities
of
Joshua
that
I
seem
to
have
thrown
into
the
shade
,
by
comparison
,
his
political
life
and
action
;
and
yet
this
was
the
more
important
of
the
two
.

The
extreme
section
of
republican
working
men
,
though
they
did
not
go
in
for
his
religious
views
,
made
use
of
his
political
zeal
;
and
when
work
was
bad
to
get
,
sometimes
he
was
sent
as
a
delegate
,
sometimes
he
went
of
his
own
accord
,
to
the
various
towns
that
needed
either
encouragement
or
awakening
;
where
he
gave
lectures
on
the
necessity
of
labour
keeping
a
close
front
against
the
serried
ranks
of
capital
;
on
the
lawfulness
and
desirability
of
trades
'
unions
and
strikes
,
when
occasion
demands
;
on
the
political
worth
of
a
republic
that
grows
naturally
out
of
monarchy
and
oligarch
,
as
manhood
grows
out
of
childhood
;
on
the
need
of
the
working
classes
raising
themselves
to
a
higher
level
in
mind
and
circumstance
than
that
which
they
occupy
now
;
on
the
beauty
of
social
and
moral
freedom
;
and
on
the
right
of
each
man
to
a
fair
share
of
the
primary
essentials
for
good
living
.

And
all
this
was
mixed
up
with
that
fervid
practical
Christianity
of
his
,
which
gave
a
new
and
holier
aspect
to
every
question
he
handled
.


Joshua
believed
in
the
religion
of
politics
.

He
often
said
that
,
were
Christ
to
come
again
in
this
day
,
He
would
be
more
of
a
politician
than
a
theologian
;
and
that
he
would
teach
men
to
work
for
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
earth
,
rather
through
the
general
elevation
of
the
material
condition
of
the
masses
than
by
either
ritual
or
dogma
.


“
You
ca
n't
make
a
man
a
saint
in
mind
,
”
I
have
heard
him
say
more
than
once
,
“
when
you
keep
him
like
a
beast
in
body
;
”
and
“
higher
wages
,
better
food
,
better
lodgment
,
and
better
education
will
do
more
to
make
men
real
Christians
than
all
the
churches
ever
built
.
”


No
man
was
more
convinced
than
he
that
sin
and
misery
are
the
removable
results
of
social
circumstances
,
and
that
poverty
,
ignorance
,
and
class
-
distinctions
consequent
,
are
at
the
root
of
all
the
crimes
and
wretchedness
ness
afloat
.

The
evil
lying
in
that
great
curse
of
partial
civilisation
—
that
upas
tree
of
caste
—
by
which
this
Christian
world
of
ours
,
with
its
religion
of
brotherhood
and
socialism
,
is
overshadowed
,
pained
him
most
of
all
.

The
caste
of
the
rich
,
with
its
product
,
the
class
antagonism
of
the
poor
—
what
a
sorry
satire
on
the
religion
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
,
that
poor
,
unlearned
man
of
the
people
,
whom
we
have
exalted
into
God
and
now
worship
with
gorgeous
ceremonial
,
while
despising
every
one
of
the
social
doctrines
He
and
His
disciples
preached
!

However
,
Joshua
did
his
best
to
rouse
men
to
a
consciousness
of
Christ
,
and
to
the
acceptance
of
His
teaching
of
human
equality
;
and
though
steadily
closed
to
all
doctrines
of
violence
,
was
always
the
passionate
upholder
of
the
doctrine
of
duty
on
the
one
side
and
the
theory
of
rights
on
the
other
.


The
different
reasons
given
by
the
various
sectarians
who
came
along
,
when
any
of
his
failures
were
afloat
,
were
what
I
have
said
before
.

The
Evangelicals
said
it
was
because
he
did
not
teach
the
Gospel
;
the
Church
people
,
because
he
was
consecrated
to
the
task
;
the
Unititarians
asked
him
,
in
calm
disdain
,
how
he
could
expect
to
do
good
,
if
he
made
no
difference
between
vice
and
virtue
but
treated
both
alike
?

while
the
Charity
Organization
people
talked
of
prosecuting
him
for
his
encouragement
of
mendicity
dicity
,
and
spoke
of
him
as
the
pest
of
the
district
and
the
cause
of
half
the
pauperism
about
,
because
he
helped
the
poor
in
their
need
without
enquiring
into
the
merits
of
the
case
.

And
they
all
agreed
that
the
weak
spot
in
his
system
,
and
the
cause
of
his
failures
,
was
just
this
—
he
was
not
a
Christian
.


In
the
midst
of
all
Mary
Prinsep
came
back
on
our
hands
.

You
may
perhaps
remember
that
her
mistress
had
made
a
point
of
concealing
her
former
life
from
every
one
;
in
which
she
was
justified
,
and
for
Mary
's
sake
as
much
as
for
her
own
.

Things
had
gone
very
well
so
far
,
and
Mary
had
satisfaction
and
worked
hard
to
deserve
it
,
when
unfortunately
that
man
who
had
known
her
only
too
well
in
the
sorrowful
days
of
her
sin
,
came
with
his
family
to
the
house
,
on
a
visit
of
a
day
or
two
.

All
the
servants
were
marshalled
into
prayers
morning
and
evening
;
and
naturally
Mary
with
them
;
face
to
face
with
the
guests
.

So
there
it
was
—
on
the
one
side
a
dignified
,
handsome
,
well
-
to
-
do
gentleman
,
with
respectable
white
hair
and
a
gold
eye
-
glass
,
a
wife
and
a
fine
young
family
,
a
character
to
lose
,
and
a
reputation
for
piety
;
on
the
other
,
a
poor
ignorant
girl
,
abandoned
by
society
,
driven
by
want
into
bad
ways
,
but
now
doing
her
best
to
get
out
of
them
.


It
was
an
awkward
meeting
for
him
,
and
he
was
afraid
maybe
of
Mary
's
establishing
a
claim
,
or
telling
what
she
knew
.

There
he
was
,
a
guest
in
her
master
's
house
,
with
his
wife
and
eldest
daughter
,
and
under
his
own
name
which
she
had
never
known
,
and
his
private
and
official
addresses
both
to
be
got
at
.

It
was
an
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
tion
,
no
doubt
;
but
it
was
cowardly
all
the
same
;
and
,
as
usual
,
the
weak
one
had
to
go
to
the
wall
.

He
made
up
an
excellent
story
to
explain
how
it
was
that
he
knew
the
girl
's
former
life
.

It
was
a
story
to
his
credit
as
a
Christian
gentleman
somehow
,
and
he
told
it
out
of
sheer
regard
for
his
good
friends
who
had
been
so
shamefully
imposed
on
.

And
even
when
the
lady
confessed
,
as
she
did
,
that
she
had
known
the
main
fact
of
Mary
's
history
,
she
was
urged
so
strongly
to
get
rid
of
her
that
she
consented
,
partly
in
a
vague
kind
of
belief
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
and
that
Mary
was
worse
than
she
appeared
and
capable
of
all
manners
of
unknown
crimes
,
partly
by
the
force
of
respectability
and
the
need
of
keeping
up
blameless
appearances
.

So
,
as
the
right
thing
to
do
considering
her
position
and
what
she
owed
her
family
and
her
own
character
,
this
lady
—
good
Christian
as
she
was
,
going
to
church
regularly
twice
on
Sunday
,
and
taking
the
sacrament
once
a
month
—
turned
the
poor
creature
out
of
doors
again
and
she
,
keeping
the
gentleman
's
secret
loyally
,
came
back
to
us
,
as
the
only
friends
she
had
.


And
at
the
word
half
-
a
-
dozen
men
and
women
,
shrieking
,
and
gesticulating
,
laid
hands
on
us
and
roughly
thrust
us
out
.

I
thought
it
fortunate
we
left
with
our
lives
,
for
indeed
,
the
wild
,
surging
crowd
was
in
no
mood
for
mercy
just
then
;
and
a
couple
of
lives
,
more
or
less
,
were
of
small
account
at
that
moment
.

Howbeit
,
we
were
flung
out
with
many
a
blow
and
bitter
word
;
and
just
as
we
were
going
through
the
gateway
a
loud
yell
burst
forth
,
a
volley
was
fired
,
and
we
knew
that
the
policy
of
Versailles
had
triumphed
.


A
few
Parisians
—
not
the
Commune
—
had
fallen
into
the
snare
prepared
for
them
;
and
the
blood
was
shed
which
was
to
cover
Liberty
with
shame
,
until
men
can
hear
and
learn
the
truth
.


The
last
day
came
.

The
guns
of
our
forts
were
silent
;
the
men
were
fighting
in
the
streets
,
desperate
,
conquered
,
but
not
craven
.

The
Versaillists
were
pouring
in
like
wolves
let
loose
;
Paris
was
drenched
with
blood
,
and
in
flames
.

And
then
the
cry
of
the
pétroleuses
went
up
like
the
fire
that
shot
against
the
sky
.

What
mattered
it
that
it
was
a
lie
?

It
gave
the
Party
of
Order
another
reason
,
if
they
had
wanted
any
,
to
excuse
their
lust
of
blood
.

It
was
their
saturnalia
,
and
they
did
not
stint
themselves
.

The
arms
,
that
had
served
them
so
ill
against
the
Prussians
,
served
them
but
too
well
against
their
countrymen
;
and
the
short
hour
of
a
nation
's
hope
was
at
an
end
in
the
bloody
reprisals
of
brothers
,
that
exceeded
all
we
have
ever
heard
or
read
of
in
a
victorious
foreign
army
.


I
had
been
separated
from
my
friends
for
more
than
twenty
-
four
hours
.

The
house
where
we
had
lodged
was
in
flames
;
and
when
I
went
to
seek
information
at
a
Communist
munist
friend
's
,
De
Lancy
,
I
found
a
group
of
three
by
the
concierge
door
—
himself
,
his
young
wife
,
and
a
little
daughter
not
two
years
old
,
lying
as
if
asleep
,
save
for
the
blood
that
was
their
bed
.

They
had
been
bound
together
and
shot
.

Not
one
,
but
hundreds
and
thousands
of
such
cases
stand
recorded
in
the
history
of
that
terrible
moment
,
when
the
victorious
Versaillists
marched
into
Paris
,
and
society
revenged
itself
on
the
men
who
had
dared
to
dream
of
redressing
its
wrongs
;
and
among
the
terrible
sights
that
met
me
,
the
evidences
of
brutal
,
wanton
,
sickening
murder
,
I
had
a
shuddering
dread
that
I
should
find
Joshua
and
Mary
.

I
was
never
so
nearly
mad
as
I
was
that
day
when
I
wandered
about
the
bloody
-
streets
of
Paris
,
looking
for
my
friends
;
sorrow
for
the
lost
cause
,
horror
at
the
scenes
I
encountered
,
and
fear
for
those
I
loved
,
all
combining
to
render
life
in
that
hour
simply
torture
.


“
No
,
sir
;
neither
church
nor
chapel
,
”
answered
Joshua
.


“
What
!

a
new
light
on
your
own
account
,
hey
?
”
and
he
laughed
as
if
he
mocked
him
.


“
No
sir
,
only
a
seeker
.
”


“
The
old
paths
not
good
enough
for
you
?

—
the
light
that
has
lightened
the
Gentiles
these
eighteen
hundred
years
and
more
not
pure
enough
for
an
unwashed
Cornish
lad
,
planing
wood
at
a
carpenter
's
bench
and
not
able
to
speak
two
consecutive
words
of
good
English
?
”


“
I
must
answer
for
my
conscience
to
God
,
sir
,
”
said
Joshua
.


“
And
your
clergyman
,
appointed
by
God
and
the
State
to
be
your
guide
,
what
of
him
?

Has
he
no
authority
in
his
own
parish
?
”
cried

Mr.
Grand
warmly
.

“
Does
it
never
strike
you
,
my
fine
fellow
,
that
in
thinking
for
yourself
,
as
you
call
it
,
you
are
flying
in
the
face
both
of
Divine
ordinances
and
the
laws
of
man
,
and
that
you
are
entering
on
the
sin
of
schism
on
the
one
hand
,
and
of
rebellion
on
the
other
?
”


“
Look
here
,
sir
,
”
said
Joshua
with
earnestness
,
but
quite
respectfully
;
“
if
I
speak
plainly
,
I
mean
it
for
no
offence
;
but
my
heart
burns
within
me
and
I
must
speak
out
.

I
deny
your
appointment
as
a
God
-
given
leader
of
souls
.

The
Church
is
but
the
old
priesthood
as
it
existed
in
the
days
of
our
Lord
,
and
is
,
as
much
as
that
was
,
the
blind
leading
the
blind
.

There
are
good
and
kind
gentlemen
among
you
,
but
not
Christians
according
to
Christ
.

I
see
no
sacrifice
of
the
world
,
no
brotherhood
with
the
poor
—
”


“
The
poor
!
”
interrupted
Mr.
Grand
disdainfully
;
“
what
would
you
have
,
you
young
fool
?

The
poor
have
the
laws
of
their
country
to
protect
them
,
and
the
Gospel
preached
to
them
for
their
salvation
.
”


“
Yes
,
and
in
preaching
that
—
that
is
,
in
giving
two
full
services
on
Sundays
,
and
reading
the
marriage
-
service
and
the
burial
-
service
and
the
like
of
that
when
you
are
wanted
—
you
discharge
your
conscience
of
all
other
obligations
towards
them
,
and
think
you
have
done
enough
.

You
never
seem
to
remember
that
when
Christ
preached
the
Gospel
to
the
poor
it
was
to
make
them
equal
with
the
rich
.

Why
,
sir
,
the
poor
of
our
day
are
the
lepers
of
Christ
's
;
and
who
among
you
,
Christian
priests
,
consorts
with
them
?

Who
ranks
the
man
above
his
station
,
or
the
soul
above
the
man
?
”


“
Now
,
we
have
come
to
it
!
”
cried

Mr.
Grand
.

“
I
thought
I
should
touch
the
secret
spring
at
last
!

And
you
would
like
us
to
associate
with
you
as
equals
?

—
Is
that
it
,
Joshua
?

Gentlemen
and
common
men
hob
-
and
-
nob
together
,
and
no
distinctions
made
?

You
to
ride
in
our
carriages
,
and
perhaps
marry
our
daughters
?
”


“
No
,
”
he
used
to
say
,
“
some
kinds
of
anger
are
righteous
;
and
this
was
of
them
.
”


But
Mr.
Grand
made
old
Davidson
,
Joshua
's
father
,
suffer
for
his
son
;
for
he
took
away
his
own
custom
from
him
,
and
did
him
what
harm
in
the
neighbourhood
a
gentleman
's
ill
-
word
can
do
a
working
man
.

It
was
a
bad
thing
for
the
old
man
.

The
Trevalga
schools
were
being
built
,
and
St.
Juliot
's
church
was
under
repair
,
and
Davidson
,
as
the
best
workman
thereabouts
,
would
have
been
sure
to
have
been
head
man
at
both
jobs
.

But
Mr.
Grand
,
he
put
his
spoke
in
that
wheel
;
and
one
day
when
I
took
courage
to
speak
and
plead
,
all
I
got
was
a
recommendation
to
mind
my
own
business
,
and
not
interfere
where
I
was
not
wanted
.

And
then
as
if
in
consideration
—a
kind
of
condescending
consideration
—
for
my
being
a
“
canter
,
”
Mr.
Grand
wound
up
with
saying
that
I
must
see
he
was
justified
according
to
the
law
of
God
.


When
I
challenged
him
hotly
,
I
daresay
intemperately
,
I
daresay
even
impertinently
,
for
his
proof
—
for
you
see
I
was
but
a
poor
uneducated
artisan
,
and
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
—
he
laughed
,
and
said
he
did
not
argue
with
carpenters
'
lads
;
and
when
I
answered
back
,
he
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
,
saying
I
was
as
pestilent
a
fellow
as
my
friend
;
—I
replying
angrily
that
I
did
not
think
the
pestilence
rested
with
Joshua
.

Which
ended
the
interview
;
not
without
loss
of
temper
and
dignity
on
both
sides
,
and
no
good
done
to
anyone
.


The
night
before
we
left
for
London
Joshua
had
a
kind
of
vision
or
waking
dream
,
which
he
told
me
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
Launceston
,
walking
up
the
hill
from
Boscastle
,
while
the
omnibus
toiled
after
us
.

He
was
on
the
cliff
by
Long
Island
,
when
suddenly
he
seemed
to
be
caught
away
to
a
wide
plain
,
where
many
men
were
gathered
.

In
the
centre
of
the
plain
was
a
hill
,
like
Brown

Willy
out
there
by
Camelford
,
and
on
this
hill
sat
two
kingly
figures
who
ruled
over
the
swarming
multitudes
below
.

They
sat
together
hand
in
hand
,
and
he
saw
that
they
were
in
some
mysterious
manner
inseparable
.

The
one
was
dressed
as
a
high
priest
,
and
was
Ecclesiastical
Christianity
;
the
other
as
a
king
,
and
was
Society
;
and
both
were
stern
,
forbidding
,
and
oppressive
.

The
only
persons
to
whom
they
showed
favour
were
the
well
-
dressed
and
the
subservient
—
rich
people
dressed
in
gold
and
jewels
,
and
the
poor
and
undistinguished
who
were
submissive
and
conforming
;
who
accepted
all
that
the
high
priest
taught
without
questioning
the
truth
of
any
part
,
and
who
obeyed
what
the
king
ordained
without
even
so
much
as
a
wish
to
resist
.

These
were
called
Believing
Christians
and
Respectable
Members
of
Society
;
and
,
in
consideration
of
their
obedience
,
both
the
high
priest
and
the
king
smiled
on
them
,
and
spoke
them
fair
.

Yet
they
were
scarcely
friendly
to
their
adherents
.

The
one
surrounded
them
with
the
most
monstrous
shapes
of
demons
cast
by
magic
lanterns
and
in
every
way
unreal
,
of
which
they
were
in
continual
fear—
GOD
,
whom
yet
they
labelled
“
Our
Father
,
”
and
the
“
God
of
Love
,
”
the
most
terrible
looking
demon
of
all
;
and
the
more
they
were
afraid
,
and
the
more
cruel
they
believed
Our
Father
to
be
,
the
more
Ecclesiastical
Christianity
was
content
.

The
other
bound
them
round
and
round
with
chains
and
swathing
bands
,
till
they
were
scarcely
able
to
move
or
breathe
.

And
when
they
submitted
to
the
stifling
torture
with
a
good
grace
—
some
of
them
even
drawing
the
links
tighter
,
and
buckling
up
the
thongs
more
home
of
their
own
accord
,
and
all
declaring
the
pattern
of
each
particular
bandage
to
have
been
sent
down
direct
from
heaven
,
and
in
no
wise
invented
as
an
experiment
by
Society
—
then
the
king
smiled
on
them
kindly
,
and
praised
them
with
many
flattering
words
;
and
the
poor
atrophied
wretches
were
quite
content
with
the
barren
honour
of
their
reward
.
