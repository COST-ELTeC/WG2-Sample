"
No
,
it
's
a
little
more
subtle
than
that
,
Shelmerdene
,
although
as
a
fact
I
do
see
a
water
rat
not
a
yard
from
you
on
the
bank
....

I
merely
wanted
to
know
how
it
was
that
,
since
you
had
a
perfectly
good
father
alive
in
England
,
you
were
allowed
to
go
gadding
about
in
France
with
a
guardian
,
soi-disant
—
—
"


"
We
will
ignore
your
soi-
disant
,
young
man
.

But
I
'll
allow
your
interruption
,
for
it
may
seem
a
bit
complicated
....

It
was
like
this
:
as
the
fortunes
of
our
family
had
run
rather
to
seed
through
generations
of
fast
women
and
slow
horses
,
my
father
who
was
utterly
a
pet
,
succumbed
to
politics
for
an
honest
living
,
or
,
if
you
pull
a
face
like
that
about
it
,
for
a
dishonest
living
.

For
up
to
that
time
,
in
spite
of
having
exactly
the
figure
for
it
,
he
had
always
refused
to
enter
Parliament
,
because
his
idea
was
that
the
House
was
just
a
club
,
and
one
already
belonged
to
so
many
better
clubs
.

But
once
there
nothing
could
stop
him
,
and
when
he
entered
for
the
Cabinet
stakes
he
simply
romped
home
with
a
soft
job
and
a
fat
income
....

But
all
that
is
really
beside
the
point
,
for
between
politics
and
guineas
father
and
I
had
had
a
slight
disagreement
about
a
certain
young
man
whom
I
was
inclined
to
marry
offhand
,
being
only
sixteen
,
you
know
,
and
liking
the
young
man
—
and
,
of
course
,
my
father
did
the
correct
thing
,
as
he
always
did
,
gave
the
young
man
a
glass
of
port
and
told
him
not
to
be
an
ass
,
and
shipped
me
off
to
Paris
to
his
very
old
friend
.

You
see
,
he
knew
about
that
old
Marquis
,
and
how
I
'd
be
quite
safe
in
his
care
,
for
any
young
man
who
as
much
as
looked
at
me
would
have
a
pair
of
gimlet
eyes
asking
him
who
the
devil
he
might
be
and
why
he
chose
to
desecrate
a
young
lady
's
virginal
beauty
by
his
so
fatuous
gaze
.


"
I
've
been
saying
a
lot
of
nice
things
about
that
old
man
to
you
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
quite
like
that
about
him
at
the
time
.

I
liked
him
,
of
course
,
because
he
was
a
man
;
but
all
that
French
business
about
the
sanctity
of
a
young
maid
's
innocence
got
badly
on
my
nerves
,
for
innocence
was
never
my
long
suit
even
from
childhood
,
having
ears
to
hear
and
eyes
to
see
;
and
I
soon
began
to
get
very
bored
with
life
as
my
old
Frenchman
saw
it
.

So
it
was
n't
surprising
that
I
broke
out
now
and
again
just
to
shock
him
,
he
was
so
rigid
,
but
I
was
always
sorry
for
it
afterwards
because
he
just
looked
at
me
and
said
not
a
word
for
a
minute
or
so
,
and
then
went
on
talking
as
though
I
had
n't
hurt
him
—
but
I
had
,
Dikran
!

I
had
hurt
him
so
much
that
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
often
could
n't
bear
to
see
me
....

But
though
I
was
ashamed
of
myself
for
hurting
him
,
I
could
n't
stop
;
life
with
him
was
interesting
enough
in
a
way
,
of
course
,
but
it
left
out
so
much
,
you
see
;
it
entirely
left
out
the
stupendous
fact
that
I
was
almost
a
woman
,
and
a
very
feminine
one
at
that
,
who
liked
an
odd
young
man
about
now
and
again
just
to
play
about
with
.

But
I
was
n't
allowed
any
young
men
,
except
a
twenty
-
five
-
year
-
old
over
-manicured
Vicomte
who
was
so
unbearably
worldly
and
useless
that
I
wanted
to
hit
him
on
the
head
with
my
guardian
's
sword
-
stick
,
which
he
always
carried
about
with
him
,
as
a
sort
of
mental
solace
,
I
think
.

No
,
there
were
n't
any
young
men
,
nor
any
restaurants
,
for
the
old
man
simply
ignored
them
;
my
dear
,
there
was
n't
anything
at
all
in
my
young
life
except
a
few
old
dukes
and
dowagers
,
and
the
aforesaid
young
Vicomte
,
who
had
manicured
himself
out
of
existence
and
was
considered
harmless
.

And
so
Paris
was
a
dead
city
to
me
who
lived
in
the
heart
of
it
,
and
all
the
more
dead
for
the
faded
old
people
who
moved
about
in
my
life
,
and
tried
to
change
my
heart
into
a
Louis
-
Quinze
drawing
-
room
hung
with
just
enough
beautiful
and
musty
tapestries
to
keep
out
the
bourgeois
sunshine
and
carelessness
,
which
I
so
longed
for
.


So
much
then
,
for
Shelmerdene
;
for
if
to
cap
it
all
,
I
should
go
on
to
say
that
she
was
beautiful
I
would
be
held
to
have
been
an
infatuated
fool
.

Which
,
perhaps
,
I
carelessly
was
,
since
I
ca
n't
even
now
exactly
fix
upon
the
colour
of
her
hair
,
doubting
now
in
memory
as
I
must
have
done
actually
in
those
past
days
with
her
,
whether
it
was
brown
or
black
or
,
as
sometimes
on
a
sofa
under
a
Liberty
-
shaded
lamp
,
a
silver
-
tinted
blue
,
so
wonderfully
deep
....

Perhaps
destined
,
in
that
future
when
Shelmerdene
is
at
last
tired
of
playing
at
life
,
to
be
the
"
blue
silver
"
of
the
besotted
madman
to
whom
she
,
at
the
weary
end
,
with
but
a
look
back
at
the
long
-
passed
procession
of
ci
-devants
,
will
thankfully
give
herself
.

Dies
iræ
,
dies
illa
....


WE
sat
on
chairs
in
the
sun
,
and
after
we
had
been
silent
a
long
while
,
she
began
to
do
what
women
will
never
cease
doing
,
so
wise
men
say
,
as
long
as
men
say
they
love
them
,
to
define
what
the
love
of
a
man
meant
to
a
woman
,
and
to
explain
the
love
of
a
man
.

She
said
that
that
man
was
wise
who
had
said
that
love
was
like
religion
,
and
must
be
done
well
or
not
at
all
,
but
that
she
had
never
yet
found
in
any
man
sincere
love
and
delicacy
,
for
there
was
always
something
coarse
,
some
little
note
which
jarred
,
some
movement
of
the
mind
and
body
maladroit
,
in
a
man
who
is
shown
a
woman
's
love
.

"
When
men
love
and
are
not
loved
,
"
she
said
,
"
often
they
kept
their
grace
and
pride
,
and
women
are
proud
to
be
loved
by
such
men
—
even
faithfully
for
more
than
ten
years
;
but
when
men
are
loved
and
are
confident
,
then
they
seem
to
lose
delicacy
,
to
think
that
love
breaks
down
all
barriers
between
man
and
woman
;
that
love
is
a
vase
of
iron
,
unbreakable
,
and
not
,
as
it
is
,
a
vase
of
the
most
delicate
and
brittle
pottery
,
to
be
broken
to
pieces
by
the
least
touch
of
a
careless
hand
.

They
seem
to
think
that
the
state
of
love
stands
at
the
end
of
a
great
striving
;
they
do
not
realise
that
it
is
only
the
beginning
,
and
that
the
striving
must
never
cease
,
for
without
striving
there
is
no
love
,
but
only
content
.

But
they
do
not
see
that
;
they
insist
on
spoiling
love
,
breaking
the
vase
with
stupid
,
unconscious
hands
;
and
when
it
breaks
they
are
surprised
,
and
they
say
that
love
is
a
fickle
thing
and
will
stand
no
tests
,
and
that
women
are
the
very
devil
.

Always
they
spoil
love
;
it
comes
and
finds
them
helpless
,
puzzling
whether
to
clothe
themselves
entirely
in
reserve
or
whether
to
be
entirely
naked
in
brutality
;
and
generally
they
compromise
,
and
,
physically
and
mentally
,
walk
about
in
their
shirts
.
"


"
On
that
day
,
towards
evening
,
he
and
I
had
managed
to
steal
out
walking
for
an
hour
.

Agreeable
enough
as
he
was
,
he
would
have
bored
me
if
I
had
let
him
.

But
I
wanted
him
,
I
intended
to
keep
him
in
my
mind
;
I
wanted
him
as
an
assertion
of
my
independence
from
the
old
man
.

As
we
went
back
up
the
drive
to
the
château
I
carefully
became
as
animated
and
smiling
as
I
could
,
for
I
knew
that
he
would
be
watching
us
from
the
drawing
-
room
windows
,
and
I
wanted
to
irritate
him
as
much
as
his
incessant
care
was
irritating
me
,
though
that
would
have
been
impossible
,
for
that
evening
I
was
absurdly
,
fiercely
angry
with
him
.

Life
seemed
made
up
of
the
interferences
of
old
men
.

I
did
n't
want
old
men
in
my
life
.

I
wanted
young
men
,
and
sunshine
,
and
fun
.

And
so
,
as
Raoul
and
I
went
up
the
steps
to
the
massive
door
,
and
as
I
turned
to
him
just
below
the
drawing
-
room
window
and
gave
him
my
most
trustful
smile
,
I
was
feeling
reckless
,
unrestrained
,
fiercely
independent
....

Oh
,
Dikran
!

what
idiocies
we
do
for
the
fancied
sake
of
independence
!


"
It
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
,
so
I
left
Raoul
and
went
straight
to
my
room
.

A
minute
later
came
a
knock
on
the
door
,
and
as
I
turned
sharply
from
the
mirror
,
it
opened
and
Raoul
stood
there
,
rather
shy
,
smiling
.

I
was
n't
old
enough
to
know
the
proper
way
of
dealing
with
young
men
in
one
's
bedroom
,
even
if
I
had
overpoweringly
wanted
to
.


"
'I
had
an
impulse
,
'
he
said
,
but
he
still
stood
in
the
doorway
,
a
little
question
somewhere
about
him
.

I
did
n't
answer
it
;
just
watched
him
,
rather
interested
in
his
methods
.


"
'
Because
,
'
he
went
on
,
'
I
used
to
sleep
in
this
room
once
,
and
remember
it
as
a
dreary
little
place
,
and
I
wanted
to
see
what
it
looked
like
with
you
in
it
.
'

Poor
silly
fool
,
I
thought
,
but
rather
loved
him
.

I
have
found
since
then
,
though
,
that
his
fatuous
speech
was
quite
the
proper
one
to
make
,
for
the
established
way
of
entering
a
woman
's
room
is
by
expressing
an
interest
in
the
furniture
,
thus
making
the
lady
self
-
conscious
and
not
so
sure
about
her
dignity
;
seductions
are
successful
through
women
fearing
to
look
fools
if
they
refuse
to
be
seduced
.


"
But
this
time
,
as
he
spoke
,
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
came
into
the
room
towards
me
.

'
This
is
n't
playing
fair
,
Raoul
,
'
I
only
said
;
'
you
will
get
me
into
a
row
.
'


"
'
Child
!
'

the
pain
in
that
one
word
,
the
lack
of
anger
in
it
,
an
utter
,
absolute
pain
accusing
me
,
did
not
soothe
.

Accuse
me
?

By
what
right
?


"
The
scene
was
dreadful
,
Dikran
.

I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
we
said
,
what
I
said
,
for
I
did
most
of
the
scene
-
making
.

He
just
forbade
me
to
talk
again
alone
with
Raoul
or
to
go
out
with
him
;
said
he
would
take
me
away
to
-
morrow
if
it
were
n't
that
explanations
would
then
be
necessary
to
our
hostess
,
who
was
in
feeble
health
and
might
be
killed
by
such
a
disgrace
as
this
in
her
own
house
.

As
for
Monsieur
le
Vicomte
,
he
himself
would
arrange
that
I
did
not
see
him
for
longer
time
than
could
be
helped
.

That
's
all
he
said
,
but
my
white
heat
took
little
notice
of
his
commands
.

I
said
I
do
n't
know
what
—
it
must
all
have
been
terrible
,
for
it
ended
on
a
terrible
note
.

Dikran
,
how
could
I
have
done
it
?

I
pointed
at
the
door
and
asked
him
how
he
could
think
he
had
more
right
in
my
room
than
Raoul
,
for
though
he
was
my
guardian
our
relations
had
been
changed
by
a
certain
proposal
,
which
perhaps
he
remembered
....

A
look
at
me
,
in
which
was
the
first
and
last
contempt
that's
ever
been
given
me
,
and
the
door
closed
on
the
wonderful
old
man
.


"
Dinner
that
night
passed
off
quite
well
considering
the
unsettled
climatic
conditions
aforesaid
.

Myself
did
n't
contribute
much
,
but
my
guardian
and
Raoul
talked
smoothly
away
about
anything
that
came
,
while
Madame
,
our
hostess
,
smiled
sweetly
at
us
all
,
on
brooding
me
in
particular
....

Quite
early
I
made
for
bed
;
the
old
man
and
I
had
n't
exchanged
a
word
all
evening
,
and
his
'
good
night
'
was
a
little
bow
,
and
mine
cold
.

As
I
passed
Raoul
he
cleverly
put
a
small
piece
of
paper
into
my
hand
.

Upstairs
in
my
room
,
that
piece
of
paper
said
that
he
would
be
going
away
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
would
I
ride
with
him
to
-
morrow
morning
before
breakfast
,
at
seven
o'clock
.

Of
course
I
would
.


"
It
was
all
a
silly
business
,
Dikran
.

If
I
had
ever
been
in
love
with
Raoul
,
I
certainly
was
n't
that
morning
when
we
rode
away
from
the
gloomy
,
silent
château
,
a
little
frightened
by
our
own
bravado
;
for
that
is
all
it
was
.

But
later
,
as
we
reached
the
sands
,
I
forgot
that
,
I
forgot
Raoul
,
though
of
course
he
always
talked
;
I
was
enjoying
the
horse
under
me
,
the
summer
morning
,
the
high
sea
wind
dashing
its
salt
air
against
my
cheeks
;
I
was
enjoying
every
one
of
those
things
more
than
the
company
of
the
young
man
,
but
,
tragically
,
my
guardian
could
not
know
that
.


Later
I
telephoned
to
Shelmerdene
to
ask
her
to
lunch
with
me
instead
of
dine
,
as
the
day
was
so
beautiful
;
but
she
said
that
she
had
already
promised
to
lunch
with
some
one
,
a
man
who
had
loved
her
faithfully
for
more
than
ten
years
,
and
as
all
he
wanted
from
her
was
her
company
over
lunch
on
this
particular
day
of
the
week
,
she
could
not
play
him
false
,
even
though
the
day
was
so
beautiful
.

But
I
told
her
that
I
would
not
be
loving
her
faithfully
for
ten
years
,
and
that
she
must
take
the
best
of
me
while
she
could
,
and
that
on
such
a
day
as
this
it
would
be
a
shame
to
lunch
with
an
inarticulate
lover
;
for
a
man
who
had
loved
her
faithfully
for
more
than
ten
years
,
and
wanted
only
her
company
over
lunch
once
a
week
,
must
be
inarticulate
,
or
perhaps
a
knave
whose
subtle
cunning
her
innocence
had
failed
to
unveil
.

So
in
the
end
we
lunched
together
in
Knightsbridge
,
and
then
walked
slowly
through
the
Park
.


The
first
covering
of
spring
lay
on
every
thing
.

The
trees
,
so
ashamed
—
or
was
it
coyness
?

—
were
they
of
their
bareness
in
face
of
all
the
greenness
around
them
,
were
doing
their
best
to
hurry
out
that
clothing
of
leaves
which
,
in
a
few
weeks
'
time
,
would
baffle
the
rays
of
the
sun
which
had
helped
their
birth
;
and
there
was
such
a
greenness
and
clearness
in
the
air
and
on
the
grass
,
and
about
the
flowers
which
seemed
surprised
at
the
new
warmth
of
the
world
,
hesitating
as
yet
to
show
their
full
beauty
for
they
were
afraid
that
the
dark
winter
was
playing
them
a
trick
and
would
suddenly
lurch
clumsily
upon
them
again
,
that
the
Park
has
never
seemed
to
me
so
beautiful
as
on
that
spring
afternoon
when
a
careless
happiness
lay
about
everything
.


So
far
I
have
not
said
a
word
about
Shelmerdene
,
except
that
she
had
found
a
man
—
or
,
rather
,
he
had
tiresomely
found
her
—
to
love
her
faithfully
for
ten
years
,
and
she
had
so
affected
him
that
he
thought
a
weekly
lunch
or
dinner
was
the
limit
of
his
destiny
with
her
.

And
yet
,
had
he
searched
himself
and
raked
out
the
least
bit
of
gumption
,
he
would
have
found
he
was
tremendously
wrong
about
her
—
for
there
were
pinnacles
to
be
reached
with
Shelmerdene
unattainable
within
the
material
limits
of
a
mere
lunch
or
dinner
.

She
was
just
such
a
delightful
adventuress
as
only
a
well
-
bred
mixture
of
American
and
English
can
sometimes
make
;
such
a
subtle
negation
of
the
morals
of
Boston
or
Kensington
that
she
would
,
in
the
searching
light
of
the
one
or
the
other
,
have
been
acclaimed
the
shining
light
of
their
William
Morris
drawing
-
rooms
.

She
drew
men
with
a
tentative
,
all
-
powerful
little
finger
,
and
mocked
them
a
little
,
but
never
so
cruelly
that
they
were
n't
,
from
the
inarticulate
beginning
to
the
inevitable
end
,
deliriously
happy
to
be
miserable
about
her
.

She
was
a
Princess
Casassimma
without
anarchical
affectations
;
and
like
her
she
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
.
