“
Sha
n’t
I
take
her
?
”
asked
Anne
.


“
Sophie
knows
how
to
manage
her
,
”
answered
Madame
Elaguine
;
and
sitting
up
,
she
drew
the
half
‐
wakened
child
close
to
her
and
kissed
her
with
convulsive
passion
.

Yet
she
let
the
maid
carry
off
the
little
one
,
and
merely
let
herself
slip
down
on
the
couch
with
a
moan
,
putting
aside
her
heavy
fur
and
passing
her
hands
through
her
pale
blond
hair
,
and
moaning
.


“
Do
n’t
you
think
you
had
better
go
?
”
said
Anne
to
Hamlin
.

“
I
will
look
after
your
cousin
.
”

She
would
loathe
to
have
Hamlin
sitting
there
,
looking
at
her
,
if
she
were
in
Madame
Elaguine
’s
condition
.


Hamlin
rose
.


“
Stop
a
minute
,
”
said
his
cousin
faintly
,
turning
round
and
fixing
her
vague
northern
blue
eyes
on
him
;
“
stop
a
minute
,
Walter
.
”


Hamlin
remained
standing
,
his
eyes
involuntarily
fixed
upon
the
curious
spectacle
of
this
prostrate
little
figure
,
panting
and
gasping
as
if
going
to
die
,
and
half
unconscious
of
any
one
’s
presence
—
her
cloak
thrown
back
on
the
sofa
,
her
hair
tangled
,
her
bare
arms
and
neck
(
for
it
was
one
of
her
caprices
always
to
go
the
play
,
even
to
the
pantomime
,
full
dress
)
half
covered
by
the
fur
of
her
pelisse
and
the
lace
of
her
dress
.


“
Stay
a
minute
;
I
want
to
explain
,
”
repeated
the
Russian
,
in
a
faint
voice
.

“
Anne
—
dear
Anne
—
where
are
you
?
”


“
Here
I
am
,
”
answered
Anne
,
in
her
cheerful
strong
voice
;
“
do
you
want
anything
,
dear
Madame
Elaguine
?
”


“
I
want
you
,
”
and
Sacha
flung
her
arms
round
Anne
’s
neck
,
and
drew
her
dark
head
close
to
her
own
little
pale
yellow
one
.

Anne
felt
her
arms
tighten
passionately
round
her
,
her
little
hand
tighten
convulsively
round
her
neck
,
as
if
the
half
‐
fainting
woman
would
throttle
her
,
—
but
she
felt
no
fear
,
only
a
vague
,
undefinable
repulsion
.

Madame

Elaguine
sighed
a
long
sigh
of
relief
,
and
loosened
her
hold
;
but
she
kept

Anne
’s
face
near
hers
,
and
kissed
her
with
hot
lips
on
the
forehead
.


“
Dear
Anne
,
”
she
said
,
“
forgive
me
.
”


“
There
is
nothing
to
forgive
,
”
said
Anne
,
trying
to
get
loose
and
to
rise
to
her
feet
.

But
Madame

Elaguine
kept
her
down
in
her
kneeling
posture
,
her
arm
always
round
Anne
’s
shoulder
.


“
I
must
explain
it
all
to
you
,
”
she
said
,
in
a
slow
,
vague
tone
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
Hamlin
.

“
Do
n’t
think
me
very
foolish
or
mad
;
but
I
thought
they
were
again
trying
to
carry
off
my
little
Helen
,—
they
have
tried
before
,
—
and
they
keep
writing
to
me
,
telling
me
that
they
will
carry
off
Helen
or
kill
me
.

I
do
n’t
care
about
that
,—
but
Helen
!
”
and
Madame

Elaguine
hid
her
face
in
Anne
’s
iron
‐
black
hair
.


“
I
beg
your
pardon
,
”
said
Hamlin
again
;
“
but
can
you
tell
me
how
I
may
get
some
breakfast
?
”


He
could
not
help
smiling
in
proffering
this
innocent
request
,
so
serious
and
almost
tragic
was
the
face
of
the
girl
.


“
It
’s
Mr
Hamlin
,
”
tittered
the
children
,
rolling
under
the
table
,
and
hanging
to
the
table
‐
cloth
.


The
young
woman
eyed
Hamlin
for
a
second
in
no
very
gracious
manner
;
then
answered
,
with
a
certain
contemptuous
listlessness
in
her
slightly
hollowed
pale
cheeks
and
beautifully
curled
but
somewhat
prominent
lips
—


“
I
do
n’t
know
anything
about
your
breakfast
,
sir
.
”

She
spoke
,
to
his
surprise
,
in
perfect
English
,
with
only
the
faintest
guttural
Italian
accent
.

“
Mr
Perry
went
to
sketch
at
Massaciuccoli
early
this
morning
,
and
took
the
boy
with
him
;
Mrs
Perry
may
never
be
disturbed
till
nine
;
and
the
cook
is
gone
to
Lucca
for
provisions
.
”


“
That
’s
very
sad
,
”
remarked
Hamlin
,
laughing
,
and
looking
at
this
curious
and
picturesque
being
.


The
girl
seemed
annoyed
at
being
discovered
in
that
guise
,
for
she
pulled
down
her
white
sleeves
quickly
.


“
I
suppose
the
cook
has
orders
about
your
breakfast
,
”
she
said
,
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
;
and
she
took
up
her
iron
once
more
.

“
Mrs
Perry
did
not
think
you
would
want
anything
so
early
;
the
cook
will
be
back
about
nine
.
”


But
Hamlin
would
not
be
shaken
off
;
the
fact
was
,
he
enjoyed
watching
this
beautiful
sullen
creature
much
as
he
might
have
enjoyed
watching
a
cat
whom
he
had
disturbed
in
its
sleep
.


“
Nine
o’clock
!
”

he
said
;
“
that
’s
a
long
time
to
wait
.

Could
n’t
you
give
me
something
to
eat
?

I
saw
a
table
spread
in
the
next
room
.
”


The
girl
put
down
her
iron
with
a
sort
of
subdued
irritation
of
manner
.


“
It
’s
the
children
’s
breakfast
,
sir
,
”
she
answered
;
“
we
have
neither
tea
nor
coffee
.
”


“
We
have
milk
,
”
said
the
eldest
of
the
little
girls
pertly
,
“
and
figs
.
”


“
Milk
and
figs
!
”
exclaimed
Hamlin
;
“
why
,
that
’s
a
breakfast
for
the
gods
!

and
wo
n’t
you
,
”
he
went
on
rather
appealingly
—“
wo
n’t
you
share
a
little
of
it
with
me
?
”


“
You
are
Mrs
Perry
’s
guest
,
”
said
the
girl
more
sullenly
than
ever
,
“
and
of
course
you
are
welcome
to
anything
you
choose
.
”


Hamlin
felt
rather
taken
aback
.


“
Indeed
!
”

he
said
.

“
I
do
n’t
wish
to
do
anything
against
the
habits
of
the
house
,
or
disagreeable
to
you
.
”


“
It
is
not
against
any
rules
,
”
she
answered
.

“
If
you
will
excuse
me
,
I
will
see
whether
the
milk
is
heated
.

The
children
will
show
you
the
way
.
”


THE
Leigh
girls
never
discovered
which
of
them
was
in
the
right
;
and
as
Anne
never
made
any
further
allusion
to
Cold
Fremley
,
they
concluded
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
Hamlin
about
it
.

Hamlin
noticed
no
change
in
her
,
but
then
he
never
expected
to
see
one
:

Anne
became
gradually
more
silent
,
more
indifferent
,
more
abrupt
in
her
answers
.

Some
people
said
,
“
She
is
getting
spoilt
by
being
made
too
much
of
;
”
and
others
,
like
Thaddy
O’
Reilly
,
hinted
that
the
vagaries
and
splendours
of
æsthetic
society
,
the
poems
and
music
and
improprieties
of
Chough
and
Dennistoun
,
the
nudities
and
Elizabethan
dramatists
of
Lewis
,
were
beginning
to
pall
upon
Miss
Brown
.

“
I
’ll
bet
anything
,
”
said
Thaddy
O’
Reilly
,
“
that
as
soon
as
they
are
married
,
the
new
Mrs
Hamlin
will
abandon
Mantegnesque
costumes
,
will
open
a
bill
with
Worth
,
and
insist
upon
hiring
a
house
in
Belgravia
for
at
least
one
season
.
”

So
said
Thaddy
O’
Reilly
;
but
it
must
be
added
that
he
said
it
to
Mrs
Spencer
,
to
alarm
and
anger
whose
hereditary
high
‐
art
passions
was
the
little
journalist
’s
great
delight
.

Anne
still
went
out
into
æsthetic
society
,
she
still
listened
to
new
poems
and
to
literary
discussions
,
she
still
sat
to
Hamlin
and
to
half
‐
a
‐
dozen
other
painters
;
but
when
people
at
concerts
or
the
play
used
to
point
out
Miss
Brown
as
the
queen
of
æstheticism
,
they
little
guessed
how
far
removed
were
the
thoughts
of
this
queen
from
her
realm
and
her
subjects
.

Ever
since
that
memorable
conversation
about
Cold
Fremley
,
beautiful
things
,—
all
the
things
—
poetry
,
painting
,
music
,
romance
—
which
had
originally
surrounded
Hamlin
with
a
sort
of
luminous
emanation
in
Anne
’s
eyes
,
—
had
grown
loathsome
to
her
.

She
knew
that
it
was
unfair
and
absurd
,
but
she
could
not
resist
the
feeling
that
all
the
fair
forms
and
sound
patterns
and
imaginary
passions
of
poetry
—
nay
,
that
the
very
beauty
of
nature
,
where
any
existed
—
were
foul
;
and
her
soul
shrank
from
them
as
from
contamination
.

She
began
to
take
a
grim
pleasure
in
that
sordid
ugliness
which
had
,
on
her
arrival
in
London
,
given
her
such
a
shock
,
and
to
which
Hamlin
and
his
friends
were
always
shutting
their
eyes
.

The
fog
,
the
black
ooze
,
the
melancholy
monotony
of
griminess
,
the
hideousness
of
the
men
and
women
in
the
streets
,
jarred
upon
her
much
less
than
the
beautiful
pictures
of
Italian
scenery
which
Hamlin
hung
up
at
Hammersmith
,
—
than
the
lovely
,
mysterious
creatures
in
jewel
‐
coloured
robes
,
wandering
in
distant
countries
of
bliss
and
romance
,
which
Hamlin
painted
.

The
poetry
of
pure
beauty
sickened
her
;
and
she
could
not
take
up
even
the
purest
poems
of
that
school
,
not
even
the
mere
charming
pieces
of
decoration
of
Morris
,
without
putting
them
down
with
disgust
.

She
began
to
feel
a
vague
nostalgic
longing
after
her
own
past
:
faint
recollections
of
her
father
’s
grimy
,
workshop
at
Spezia
,
of
the
poor
little
room
where
her
mother
had
sat
doing
cheap
dressmaking
,
returned
to
her
.

The
life
at
Florence
,
the
sordid
life
with
the
Perrys
,
the
tattered
furniture
and
ill
‐
swept
rooms
,
the
dirty
and
noisy
kitchen
with
the
haunting
smell
of
sink
;
the
dull
routine
of
washing
and
ironing
and
mending
,
of
dressing
and
undressing
the
refractory
children
,
of
teaching
them
their
letters
and
trying
to
keep
them
tidy
;
the
ill
‐
will
,
the
muttered
anger
,
the
jeering
scraps
of
song
of
the
other
servants
,
who
resented
Anne
’s
superiority
,
—
all
these
recollections
which
had
almost
been
effaced
during
her
happy
new
life
at
Coblenz
and
in
London
,
returned
to
her
,
vivid
as
reality
,
and
filled
her
with
unaccountable
yearning
.

And
yet
,
when
she
asked
herself
what
this
meant
,
she
could
not
but
confess
that
she
was
different
from
what
she
had
then
been
;
that
she
had
absorbed
too
much
of
the
new
life
ever
to
be
happy
in
the
old
one
—
nay
,
that
that
very
indignation
with
the
mere
selfish
worship
of
beauty
which
made
all
things
seem
black
in
her
eyes
,
would
never
have
been
possible
had
she
remained
a
mere
servant
.

Hamlin
had
redeemed
her
soul
;
he
had
made
her
a
thinking
and
feeling
being
—
but
what
for
?

She
dared
not
admit
to
herself
that
it
was
merely
in
order
that
she
should
despise
him
.


“
I
am
willing
to
judge
art
from
an
artistic
standpoint
;
but
I
can
not
judge
from
an
artistic
standpoint
an
honourable
man
trying
to
defame
himself
.
”


Hamlin
sighed
.


“
Well
,
after
all
,
I
bade
you
select
,
and
the
principal
thing
is
that
you
should
be
satisfied
.

But
it
is
a
pity
,
because
those
were
just
the
best
sonnets
in
the
book
;
and
the
book
will
be
very
small
without
the
‘
Ballad
of
the
Fens
.
’
”


“
The
‘
Ballad
of
the
Fens’?
—
are
n’t
you
going
to
print
that
?

What
do
you
mean
?
”


Could
Hamlin
be
merely
worrying
her
,
to
vent
his
annoyance
at
the
loss
of
the
sonnets
?


“
The
‘
Ballad
of
the
Fens
’
has
been
torn
up
,
”
answered
Hamlin
,
with
a
kind
of
dogged
satisfaction
.


“
Oh
,
Mr
Hamlin
!

How
could
you
—
the
finest
thing
you
have
ever
written
.
”


The
ballad
torn
up
!


“
I
know
you
thought
it
good
,
and
so
did
I
myself
.

But
,
on
reflection
,
I
saw
that
my
friends
were
right
,
and
that
such
a
thing
would
not
do
.
”


He
spoke
sharply
,
brutally
,
as
if
to
bring
home
to
Anne
the
unreliableness
of
her
judgment
:
she
had
induced
him
to
write
it
;
she
had
praised
it
;
and
she
wanted
him
to
tear
up
those
sonnets
.


“
It
is
a
bad
plan
to
keep
things
about
which
one
is
doubtful
,
”
he
went
on
;
“
so
I
tore
it
up
.

I
think
it
was
wiser
;
do
n’t
you
?
”


“
No
,
”
said
Anne
,
in
a
husky
voice
which
burst
out
in
a
way
that
almost
frightened
him
;
“
no
,
no
—
it
was
.
.
.
”
but
she
said
no
more
.


ONE
morning
Hamlin
received
two
unexpected
letters
at
breakfast
.

From
his
looks
,
which
he
was
at
all
times
quite
unable
to
control
,
it
was
clear
that
one
of
them
brought
good
news
,
while
the
other
must
be
about
some
disagreeable
matter
.


“
Edmund
Lewis
is
coming
the
day
after
to
‐
morrow
,
”
announced
Hamlin
to
his
aunt
,
to
Anne
,
and
to
his
guests
.


There
was
a
chorus
of
exclamations
of
surprise
,
sprinkled
with
pleasure
.


“
Who
is
Edmund
Lewis
?
”
asked
Anne
.

“
He
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
a
charming
fellow
whom
I
have
not
seen
for
some
years
.

Some
of
the
drawings
in
the
drawing
‐
room
at
Hammersmith
are
by
him
.
”


Anne
remembered
the
name
,
and
the
strange
,
beautiful
,
cruel
,
mysterious
,
out
‐
of
‐
drawing
heads
in
crayon
,
which
had
curiously
impressed
her
the
first
morning
after
her
arrival
in
England
,
rose
before
her
eyes
;
since
then
she
had
seen
so
many
similar
things
,
had
got
to
understand
so
completely
that
mysterious
,
beautiful
faces
,
with
combed
‐
out
hair
,
big
weird
eyes
,
and
cruel
lips
,
were
so
much
school
property
,
that
she
had
become
quite
indifferent
to
them
.


“
I
thought
you
told
me
that
something
strange
had
happened
to
him
—
that
he
had
left
England
for
good
,
”
remarked
Anne
.


“
Oh
,
it
was
nothing
particularly
strange
,
”
interrupted
little
O’
Reilly
—“
only
a
German
lady
whom
he
met
one
day
,
blond
,
fat
,
thirty
‐
five
,
who
was
nothing
but
a
soul
—
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
—
with
a
husband
who
was
a
great
deal
besides
a
soul
(
a
charming
man
,
for
the
rest
,
and
quite
wildly
in
love
with
the
Gnädige
Frau
)
.

The
excess
of
soul
having
induced
acute
neuralgia
in
the
lady
,
poor
Teddy
Lewis
,
who
is
a
tremendous
magnetiser
,
was
called
in
to
soothe
her
agonies
,
during
which
process
the
lady
discovered
that
the
soul
‐
sorrow
and
consequent
neuralgia
from
which
she
suffered
was
due
to
the
soullessness
of
her
husband
,
and
that
only
the
brotherly
affection
of
Ted
could
cure
her
.

The
difficulty
was
the
husband
,
who
loved
the
lady
fervently
,
and
she
him
,
but
not
in
a
way
which
should
satisfy
her
soul
.

Hence
struggles
,
agonies
,
&c
.
—
you
’ve
read
it
all
in
the
‘
Wahlverwandschaften
’
—
finally
ended
by
the
husband
being
implored
to
sacrifice
himself
to
the
spiritual
exigencies
of
his
adored
wife
,
which
absolutely
required
that
he
should
divorce
her
and
let
her
marry
Lewis
.

That
’s
all
.
”


“
How
can
you
talk
in
such
a
flippant
way
,
Mr
O’
Reilly
?
”
cried
Mrs
Spencer
.

“
You
have
a
way
of
making
the
most
serious
things
seem
ridiculous
.

Poor
Mrs
Lewis
!

she
’s
dead
now
;
you
need
n’t
make
fun
of
her
.
”


“
Poor
Mrs
Lewis
!
”
laughed
O’Reilly
;
“
well
,
you
know
you
would
n’t
receive
her
,
Mrs
Spencer
,
when
she
first
came
to
England
.
”


“
I
thought
her
a
designing
woman
then
;
I
did
n’t
know
all
the
circumstances
.
”


“
Come
now
,
Edith
,
”
interrupted
her
father
,
in
his
broad
Scotch
;
“
I
think
the
less
ye
knew
those
circumstances
the
better
it
was
for
all
concerned
.
”


“
I
do
n’t
see
that
at
all
,
papa
.

I
do
n’t
see
why
a
woman
’s
happiness
should
be
sacrificed
,
”
and
Mrs
Spencer
,
who
was
the
most
devoted
of
wives
and
mothers
,
tossed
her
head
rebelliously
.

“
I
do
n’t
see
why
the
world
should
insist
that
a
woman
is
to
be
satisfied
with
a
husband
who
is
good
to
her
and
her
children
.

After
all
,
she
has
a
soul
,
and
that
requires
response
.
”


“
Would
you
behave
as
Mrs
Lewis
did
?
”
asked
O’Reilly
,
“
If
—
well
—
let
me
see
—
Mr
Spencer
were
suddenly
to
develop
an
overpowering
belief
in
the
Royal
Academy
and
in
Zola
?
”


“
Papa
would
never
have
let
me
marry
a
man
who
could
ever
develop
such
beliefs
.
”
