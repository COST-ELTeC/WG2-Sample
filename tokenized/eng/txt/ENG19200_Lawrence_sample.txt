There
were
long
spaces
of
silence
between
their
words
.

The
wrestling
had
some
deep
meaning
to
them
—
an
unfinished
meaning
.


“
We
are
mentally
,
spiritually
intimate
,
therefore
we
should
be
more
or
less
physically
intimate
too
—
it
is
more
whole
.
”


“
Certainly
it
is
,
”
said
Gerald
.

Then
he
laughed
pleasantly
,
adding
:
“
It
’s
rather
wonderful
to
me
.
”

He
stretched
out
his
arms
handsomely
.


“
Yes
,
”
said
Birkin
.

“
I
do
n’t
know
why
one
should
have
to
justify
oneself
.
”


“
No
.
”


The
two
men
began
to
dress
.


“
I
think
also
that
you
are
beautiful
,
”
said
Birkin
to
Gerald
,
“
and
that
is
enjoyable
too
.

One
should
enjoy
what
is
given
.
”


“
You
think
I
am
beautiful
—
how
do
you
mean
,
physically
?
”
asked
Gerald
,
his
eyes
glistening
.


“
Yes
.

You
have
a
northern
kind
of
beauty
,
like
light
refracted
from
snow
—
and
a
beautiful
,
plastic
form
.

Yes
,
that
is
there
to
enjoy
as
well
.

We
should
enjoy
everything
.
”


Gerald
laughed
in
his
throat
,
and
said
:


“
That
’s
certainly
one
way
of
looking
at
it
.

I
can
say
this
much
,
I
feel
better
.

It
has
certainly
helped
me
.

Is
this
the
Bruderschaft
you
wanted
?
”


“
Perhaps
.

Do
you
think
this
pledges
anything
?
”


“
I
do
n’t
know
,
”
laughed
Gerald
.


“
At
any
rate
,
one
feels
freer
and
more
open
now
—
and
that
is
what
we
want
.
”


“
Certainly
,
”
said
Gerald
.


They
drew
to
the
fire
,
with
the
decanters
and
the
glasses
and
the
food
.


“
I
always
eat
a
little
before
I
go
to
bed
,
”
said
Gerald
.

“
I
sleep
better
.
”


“
I
should
not
sleep
so
well
,
”
said
Birkin
.


“
No
?

There
you
are
,
we
are
not
alike
.

I
’ll
put
a
dressing
-
gown
on
.
”

Birkin
remained
alone
,
looking
at
the
fire
.

His
mind
had
reverted
to
Ursula
.

She
seemed
to
return
again
into
his
consciousness
.

Gerald
came
down
wearing
a
gown
of
broad
-
barred
,
thick
black
-
and
-
green
silk
,
brilliant
and
striking
.


“
You
are
very
fine
,
”
said
Birkin
,
looking
at
the
full
robe
.


“
It
was
a
caftan
in
Bokhara
,
”
said
Gerald
.

“
I
like
it
.
”


“
I
like
it
too
.
”


Birkin
was
silent
,
thinking
how
scrupulous
Gerald
was
in
his
attire
,
how
expensive
too
.

He
wore
silk
socks
,
and
studs
of
fine
workmanship
,
and
silk
underclothing
,
and
silk
braces
.

Curious
!

This
was
another
of
the
differences
between
them
.

Birkin
was
careless
and
unimaginative
about
his
own
appearance
.


“
Of
course
you
,
”
said
Gerald
,
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
;
“
there
’s
something
curious
about
you
.

You
’re
curiously
strong
.

One
does
n’t
expect
it
,
it
is
rather
surprising
.
”


Birkin
laughed
.

He
was
looking
at
the
handsome
figure
of
the
other
man
,
blond
and
comely
in
the
rich
robe
,
and
he
was
half
thinking
of
the
difference
between
it
and
himself
—so
different
;
as
far
,
perhaps
,
apart
as
man
from
woman
,
yet
in
another
direction
.

But
really
it
was
Ursula
,
it
was
the
woman
who
was
gaining
ascendance
over
Birkin
’s
being
,
at
this
moment
.

Gerald
was
becoming
dim
again
,
lapsing
out
of
him
.


There
was
a
long
pause
.

His
voice
had
become
hot
and
very
sarcastic
.

Ursula
was
troubled
and
bewildered
,
they
were
both
oblivious
of
everything
but
their
own
immersion
.


“
But
even
if
everybody
is
wrong
—
where
are
you
right
?
”
she
cried
,
“
where
are
you
any
better
?
”


“
I
?

—I
’m
not
right
,
”
he
cried
back
.

“
At
least
my
only
rightness
lies
in
the
fact
that
I
know
it
.

I
detest
what
I
am
,
outwardly
.

I
loathe
myself
as
a
human
being
.

Humanity
is
a
huge
aggregate
lie
,
and
a
huge
lie
is
less
than
a
small
truth
.

Humanity
is
less
,
far
less
than
the
individual
,
because
the
individual
may
sometimes
be
capable
of
truth
,
and
humanity
is
a
tree
of
lies
.

And
they
say
that
love
is
the
greatest
thing
;
they
persist
in
saying
this
,
the
foul
liars
,
and
just
look
at
what
they
do
!

Look
at
all
the
millions
of
people
who
repeat
every
minute
that
love
is
the
greatest
,
and
charity
is
the
greatest
—
and
see
what
they
are
doing
all
the
time
.

By
their
works
ye
shall
know
them
,
for
dirty
liars
and
cowards
,
who
dare
n’t
stand
by
their
own
actions
,
much
less
by
their
own
words
.
”


“
But
,
”
said
Ursula
sadly
,
“
that
does
n’t
alter
the
fact
that
love
is
the
greatest
,
does
it
?

What
they
do
does
n’t
alter
the
truth
of
what
they
say
,
does
it
?
”


“
Completely
,
because
if
what
they
say
were
true
,
then
they
could
n’t
help
fulfilling
it
.

But
they
maintain
a
lie
,
and
so
they
run
amok
at
last
.

It
’s
a
lie
to
say
that
love
is
the
greatest
.

You
might
as
well
say
that
hate
is
the
greatest
,
since
the
opposite
of
everything
balances
.

What
people
want
is
hate
—
hate
and
nothing
but
hate
.

And
in
the
name
of
righteousness
and
love
,
they
get
it
.

They
distil
themselves
with
nitroglycerine
,
all
the
lot
of
them
,
out
of
very
love
.

It
’s
the
lie
that
kills
.

If
we
want
hate
,
let
us
have
it
—
death
,
murder
,
torture
,
violent
destruction
—
let
us
have
it
:
but
not
in
the
name
of
love
.

But
I
abhor
humanity
,
I
wish
it
was
swept
away
.

It
could
go
,
and
there
would
be
no
absolute
loss
,
if
every
human
being
perished
tomorrow
.

The
reality
would
be
untouched
.

Nay
,
it
would
be
better
.

The
real
tree
of
life
would
then
be
rid
of
the
most
ghastly
,
heavy
crop
of
Dead
Sea
Fruit
,
the
intolerable
burden
of
myriad
simulacra
of
people
,
an
infinite
weight
of
mortal
lies
.
”


“
And
now
you
will
always
see
them
,
”
he
said
.


“
Now
I
shall
always
see
them
,
”
she
repeated
.

“
Thank
you
so
much
for
showing
me
.

I
think
they
’re
so
beautiful
—
little
red
flames
—
”


Her
absorption
was
strange
,
almost
rhapsodic
.

Both
Birkin
and
Ursula
were
suspended
.

The
little
red
pistillate
flowers
had
some
strange
,
almost
mystic
-
passionate
attraction
for
her
.


The
lesson
was
finished
,
the
books
were
put
away
,
at
last
the
class
was
dismissed
.

And
still
Hermione
sat
at
the
table
,
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
,
her
elbow
on
the
table
,
her
long
white
face
pushed
up
,
not
attending
to
anything
.

Birkin
had
gone
to
the
window
,
and
was
looking
from
the
brilliantly
-
lighted
room
on
to
the
grey
,
colourless
outside
,
where
rain
was
noiselessly
falling
.

Ursula
put
away
her
things
in
the
cupboard
.


At
length
Hermione
rose
and
came
near
to
her
.


“
Your
sister
has
come
home
?
”

she
said
.


“
Yes
,
”
said
Ursula
.


“
And
does
she
like
being
back
in
Beldover
?
”


“
No
,
”
said
Ursula
.


“
No
,
I
wonder
she
can
bear
it
.

It
takes
all
my
strength
,
to
bear
the
ugliness
of
this
district
,
when
I
stay
here
.

Wo
n’t
you
come
and
see
me
?

Wo
n’t
you
come
with
your
sister
to
stay
at
Breadalby
for
a
few
days
?
—
do
—
”


“
Thank
you
very
much
,
”
said
Ursula
.


“
Then
I
will
write
to
you
,
”
said
Hermione
.

“
You
think
your
sister
will
come
?

I
should
be
so
glad
.

I
think
she
is
wonderful
.

I
think
some
of
her
work
is
really
wonderful
.

I
have
two
water
-
wagtails
,
carved
in
wood
,
and
painted
—
perhaps
you
have
seen
it
?
”


“
No
,
”
said
Ursula
.


“
I
think
it
is
perfectly
wonderful
—
like
a
flash
of
instinct
.
”


“
Her
little
carvings
are
strange
,
”
said
Ursula
.


“
Perfectly
beautiful
—
full
of
primitive
passion
—
”


“
Is
n’t
it
queer
that
she
always
likes
little
things
?

—
she
must
always
work
small
things
,
that
one
can
put
between
one
’s
hands
,
birds
and
tiny
animals
.

She
likes
to
look
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
opera
glasses
,
and
see
the
world
that
way
—
why
is
it
,
do
you
think
?
”


Hermione
looked
down
at
Ursula
with
that
long
,
detached
scrutinising
gaze
that
excited
the
younger
woman
.


“
Yes
,
”
said
Hermione
at
length
.

“
It
is
curious
.

The
little
things
seem
to
be
more
subtle
to
her
—
”


“
But
they
are
n’t
,
are
they
?

A
mouse
is
n’t
any
more
subtle
than
a
lion
,
is
it
?
”


Again
Hermione
looked
down
at
Ursula
with
that
long
scrutiny
,
as
if
she
were
following
some
train
of
thought
of
her
own
,
and
barely
attending
to
the
other
’s
speech
.


“
Can
one
?
”
cried

Ursula
in
surprise
.


He
looked
up
at
her
with
a
communicative
smile
.


“
Oh
yes
,
plainly
.
”


She
was
pleased
.

She
meditated
a
moment
.


“
And
can
you
see
that
Rupert
is
happy
as
well
?
”


He
lowered
his
eyelids
,
and
looked
aside
.


“
Oh
yes
,
”
he
said
.


“
Really
!
”


“
Oh
yes
.
”


He
was
very
quiet
,
as
if
it
were
something
not
to
be
talked
about
by
him
.

He
seemed
sad
.


She
was
very
sensitive
to
suggestion
.

She
asked
the
question
he
wanted
her
to
ask
.


“
Why
do
n’t
you
be
happy
as
well
?
”

she
said
.

“
You
could
be
just
the
same
.
”


He
paused
a
moment
.


“
With
Gudrun
?
”

he
asked
.


“
Yes
!
”
she
cried
,
her
eyes
glowing
.

But
there
was
a
strange
tension
,
an
emphasis
,
as
if
they
were
asserting
their
wishes
,
against
the
truth
.


“
You
think
Gudrun
would
have
me
,
and
we
should
be
happy
?
”

he
said
.


“
Yes
,
I
’m
sure
!
”
she
cried
.


Her
eyes
were
round
with
delight
.

Yet
underneath
she
was
constrained
,
she
knew
her
own
insistence
.


“
Oh
,
I
’m
so
glad
,
”
she
added
.


He
smiled
.


“
What
makes
you
glad
?
”

he
said
.


“
For
her
sake
,
”
she
replied
.

“
I
’m
sure
you
’d
—
you
’re
the
right
man
for
her
.
”


“
You
are
?
”

he
said
.

“
And
do
you
think
she
would
agree
with
you
?
”


“
Oh
yes
!
”
she
exclaimed
hastily
.

Then
,
upon
reconsideration
,
very
uneasy
:
“
Though
Gudrun
is
n’t
so
very
simple
,
is
she
?

One
does
n’t
know
her
in
five
minutes
,
does
one
?

She
’s
not
like
me
in
that
.
”

She
laughed
at
him
with
her
strange
,
open
,
dazzled
face
.


“
You
think
she
’s
not
much
like
you
?
”

Gerald
asked
.


She
knitted
her
brows
.


“
Oh
,
in
many
ways
she
is
.

But
I
never
know
what
she
will
do
when
anything
new
comes
.
”


“
You
do
n’t
?
”
said
Gerald
.

He
was
silent
for
some
moments
.

Then
he
moved
tentatively
.

“
I
was
going
to
ask
her
,
in
any
case
,
to
go
away
with
me
at
Christmas
,
”
he
said
,
in
a
very
small
,
cautious
voice
.


“
Go
away
with
you
?

For
a
time
,
you
mean
?
”


“
As
long
as
she
likes
,
”
he
said
,
with
a
deprecating
movement
.


They
were
both
silent
for
some
minutes
.


“
Of
course
,
”
said
Ursula
at
last
,
“
she
might
just
be
willing
to
rush
into
marriage
.

You
can
see
.
”


“
Yes
,
”
smiled
Gerald
.

“
I
can
see
.

But
in
case
she
wo
n’t
—
do
you
think
she
would
go
abroad
with
me
for
a
few
days
—
or
for
a
fortnight
?
”


“
Oh
yes
,
”
said
Ursula
.

“
I
’d
ask
her
.
”


“
Do
you
think
we
might
all
go
together
?
”


“
I
ca
n’t
see
what
you
will
leave
me
at
all
,
to
be
interested
in
,
”
came
Gerald
’s
voice
from
the
lower
room
.

“
Neither
the
Pussums
,
nor
the
mines
,
nor
anything
else
.
”


“
You
be
interested
in
what
you
can
,
Gerald
.

Only
I
’m
not
interested
myself
,
”
said
Birkin
.


“
What
am
I
to
do
at
all
,
then
?
”
came
Gerald
’s
voice
.


“
What
you
like
.

What
am
I
to
do
myself
?
”


In
the
silence
Birkin
could
feel
Gerald
musing
this
fact
.


“
I
’m
blest
if
I
know
,
”
came
the
good
-
humoured
answer
.


“
You
see
,
”
said
Birkin
,
“
part
of
you
wants
the
Pussum
,
and
nothing
but
the
Pussum
,
part
of
you
wants
the
mines
,
the
business
,
and
nothing
but
the
business
—
and
there
you
are
—
all
in
bits
—
”


“
And
part
of
me
wants
something
else
,
”
said
Gerald
,
in
a
queer
,
quiet
,
real
voice
.


“
What
?
”
said
Birkin
,
rather
surprised
.


“
That
’s
what
I
hoped
you
could
tell
me
,
”
said
Gerald
.


There
was
a
silence
for
some
time
.


“
I
ca
n’t
tell
you
—I
ca
n’t
find
my
own
way
,
let
alone
yours
.

You
might
marry
,
”
Birkin
replied
.


“
Who
—
the
Pussum
?
”
asked
Gerald
.


“
Perhaps
,
”
said
Birkin
.

And
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
.


“
That
is
your
panacea
,
”
said
Gerald
.

“
But
you
have
n’t
even
tried
it
on
yourself
yet
,
and
you
are
sick
enough
.
”


“
I
am
,
”
said
Birkin
.

“
Still
,
I
shall
come
right
.
”


“
Through
marriage
?
”


“
Yes
,
”
Birkin
answered
obstinately
.


“
And
no
,
”
added
Gerald
.

“
No
,
no
,
no
,
my
boy
.
”


There
was
a
silence
between
them
,
and
a
strange
tension
of
hostility
.

They
always
kept
a
gap
,
a
distance
between
them
,
they
wanted
always
to
be
free
each
of
the
other
.

Yet
there
was
a
curious
heart
-
straining
towards
each
other
.


“
Salvator
femininus
,
”
said
Gerald
,
satirically
.


“
Why
not
?
”
said
Birkin
.


“
No
reason
at
all
,
”
said
Gerald
,
“
if
it
really
works
.

But
whom
will
you
marry
?
”


“
A
woman
,
”
said
Birkin
.


“
Good
,
”
said
Gerald
.


Birkin
and
Gerald
were
the
last
to
come
down
to
breakfast
.

Hermione
liked
everybody
to
be
early
.

She
suffered
when
she
felt
her
day
was
diminished
,
she
felt
she
had
missed
her
life
.

She
seemed
to
grip
the
hours
by
the
throat
,
to
force
her
life
from
them
.

She
was
rather
pale
and
ghastly
,
as
if
left
behind
,
in
the
morning
.

Yet
she
had
her
power
,
her
will
was
strangely
pervasive
.

With
the
entrance
of
the
two
young
men
a
sudden
tension
was
felt
.


She
lifted
her
face
,
and
said
,
in
her
amused
sing
-
song
:


“
Good
morning
!

Did
you
sleep
well
?

I
’m
so
glad
.
”
