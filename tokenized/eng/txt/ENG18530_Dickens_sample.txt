“
Encourager
!
”
returned
my
guardian
again
.

“
Who
could
be
encouraged
by
Skimpole
?
”


“
Not
Richard
?
”

I
asked
.


“
No
,
”
he
replied
.

“
Such
an
unworldly
,
uncalculating
,
gossamer
creature
,
is
a
relief
to
him
,
and
an
amusement
.

But
as
to
advising
or
encouraging
,
or
occupying
a
serious
station
towards
anybody
or
anything
,
it
is
simply
not
to
be
thought
of
in
such
a
child
as
Skimpole
.
”


“
Pray
,
cousin
John
,
”
said
Ada
,
who
had
just
joined
us
,
and
now
looked
over
my
shoulder
,
“
what
made
him
such
a
child
?
”


“
What
made
him
such
a
child
?
”

inquired
my
guardian
,
rubbing
his
head
,
a
little
at
a
loss
.


“
Yes
,
cousin
John
.
”


“
Why
,
”
he
slowly
replied
,
roughening
his
head
more
and
more
,
“
he
is
all
sentiment
,
and
—
and
susceptibility
,
and
—
and
sensibility
—
and
—
and
imagination
.

And
these
qualities
are
not
regulated
in
him
,
somehow
.

I
suppose
the
people
who
admired
him
for
them
in
his
youth
,
attached
too
much
importance
to
them
,
and
too
little
to
any
training
that
would
have
balanced
and
adjusted
them
;
and
so
he
became
what
he
is
.

Hey
?
”
said
my
guardian
,
stopping
short
,
and
looking
at
us
hopefully
.

“
What
do
you
think
,
you
two
?
”


Ada
,
glancing
at
me
,
said
she
thought
it
was
a
pity
he
should
be
an
expense
to
Richard
.


“
So
it
is
,
so
it
is
,
”
returned
my
guardian
,
hurriedly
.

“
That
must
not
be
.

We
must
arrange
that
.

I
must
prevent
it
.

That
will
never
do
.
”


And
I
said
I
thought
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
he
had
ever
introduced
Richard
to
Mr.
Vholes
,
for
a
present
of
five
pounds
.


“
Did
he
?
”
said
my
guardian
,
with
a
passing
shade
of
vexation
on
his
face
.

“
But
there
you
have
the
man
.

There
you
have
the
man
!

There
is
nothing
mercenary
in
that
,
with
him
.

He
has
no
idea
of
the
value
of
money
.

He
introduces
Rick
;
and
then
he
is
good
friends
with
Mr.
Vholes
,
and
borrows
five
pounds
of
him
.

He
means
nothing
by
it
,
and
thinks
nothing
of
it
.

He
told
you
himself
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
my
dear
?
”


“
O
yes
!
”
said
I
.


“
Exactly
!
”
cried
my
guardian
,
quite
triumphant
.

“
There
you
have
the
man
!

If
he
had
meant
any
harm
by
it
,
or
was
conscious
of
any
harm
in
it
,
he
would
n't
tell
it
.

He
tells
it
as
he
does
it
,
in
mere
simplicity
.

But
you
shall
see
him
in
his
own
home
,
and
then
you
'll
understand
him
better
.

We
must
pay
a
visit
to
Harold
Skimpole
,
and
caution
him
on
these
points
.

Lord
bless
you
,
my
dears
,
an
infant
,
an
infant
!
”


“
You
may
bring
the
letters
,
”
she
repeats
,
in
the
same
tone
,
“
if
you
—
—
please
.
”


“
It
shall
be
done
.

I
wish
your
ladyship
good
day
.
”


On
a
table
near
her
is
a
rich
bauble
of
a
casket
,
barred
and
clasped
like
an
old
strong
chest
.

She
,
looking
at
him
still
,
takes
it
to
her
and
unlocks
it
.


“
Oh
!

I
assure
your
ladyship

I
am
not
actuated
by
any
motives
of
that
sort
,
”
says
Mr.
Guppy
;
“
and
I
could
n't
accept
of
anything
of
the
kind
.

I
wish
your
ladyship
good
day
,
and
am
much
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
.
”


So
the
young
man
makes
his
bow
,
and
goes
down
-
stairs
;
where
the
supercilious
Mercury
does
not
consider
himself
called
upon
to
leave
his
Olympus
by
the
hall
-
fire
,
to
let
the
young
man
out
.


As
Sir
Leicester
basks
in
his
library
,
and
dozes
over
his
newspaper
,
is
there
no
influence
in
the
house
to
startle
him
;
not
to
say
,
to
make
the
very
trees
at
Chesney
Wold
fling
up
their
knotted
arms
,
the
very
portraits
frown
,
the
very
armour
stir
?


No
.

Words
,
sobs
,
and
cries
,
are
but
air
;
and
air
is
so
shut
in
and
shut
out
throughout
the
house
in
town
,
that
sounds
need
be
uttered
trumpet
-
tongued
indeed
by
my
Lady
in
her
chamber
,
to
carry
any
faint
vibration
to
Sir
Leicester
's
ears
;
and
yet
this
cry
is
in
the
house
,
going
upward
from
a
wild
figure
on
its
knees
.


“
O
my
child
,
my
child
!

Not
dead
in
the
first
hours
of
her
life
,
as
my
cruel
sister
told
me
;
but
sternly
nurtured
by
her
,
after
she
had
renounced
me
and
my
name
!

O
my
child
,
O
my
child
!
”


RICHARD
had
been
gone
away
some
time
,
when
a
visitor
came
to
pass
a
few
days
with
us
.

It
was
an
elderly
lady
.

It
was
Mrs.
Woodcourt
,
who
,
having
come
from
Wales
to
stay
with
Mrs.
Bayham
Badger
,
and
having
written
to
my
guardian
,
“
by
her
son
Allan
's
desire
,
”
to
report
that
she
had
heard
from
him
and
that
he
was
well
,
“
and
sent
his
kind
remembrances
to
all
of
us
,
”
had
been
invited
by
my
guardian
to
make
a
visit
to
Bleak
House
.

She
stayed
with
us
nearly
three
weeks
.

She
took
very
kindly
to
me
,
and
was
extremely
confidential
:
so
much
so
that
sometimes
she
almost
made
me
uncomfortable
.

I
had
no
right
,
I
knew
very
well
,
to
be
uncomfortable
because
she
confided
in
me
,
and
I
felt
it
was
unreasonable
;
still
,
with
all
I
could
do
,
I
could
not
quite
help
it
.


“
I
did
mean
you
,
child
,
”
replied
her
mistress
,
calmly
.

“
Put
that
shawl
on
me
.
”


She
slightly
stooped
her
shoulders
to
receive
it
,
and
the
pretty
girl
lightly
dropped
it
in
its
place
.

The
Frenchwoman
stood
unnoticed
,
looking
on
with
her
lips
very
tightly
set
.


“
I
am
sorry
,
”
said
Lady
Dedlock
to
Mr.
Jarndyee
,
“
that
we
are
not
likely
to
renew
our
former
acquaintance
.

You
will
allow
me
to
send
the
carriage
back
for
your
two
wards
.

It
shall
be
here
directly
.
”


But
,
as
he
would
on
no
account
accept
this
offer
,
she
took
a
graceful
leave
of
Ada
—
none
of
me
—
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
proffered
arm
,
and
got
into
the
carriage
;
which
was
a
little
,
low
,
park
carriage
,
with
a
hood
.


“
Come
in
,
child
!
”
she
said
to
the
pretty
girl
,
“
I
shall
want
you
.

Go
on
!
”


The
carriage
rolled
away
;
and
the
Frenchwoman
,
with
the
wrappers
she
had
brought
hanging
over
her
arm
,
remained
standing
where
she
had
alighted
.


I
suppose
there
is
nothing
Pride
can
so
little
bear
with
,
as
Pride
itself
,
and
that
she
was
punished
for
her
imperious
manner
.

Her
retaliation
was
the
most
singular
I
could
have
imagined
.

She
remained
perfectly
still
until
the
carriage
had
turned
into
the
drive
,
and
then
,
without
the
least
discomposure
of
countenance
,
slipped
off
her
shoes
,
left
them
on
the
ground
,
and
walked
deliberately
in
the
same
direction
,
through
the
wettest
of
the
wet
grass
.


“
Is
that
young
woman
mad
?
”
said
my
guardian
.


“
O
no
,
sir
!
”
said
the
keeper
,
who
,
with
his
wife
,
was
looking
after
her
.

“
Hortense
is
not
one
of
that
sort
.

She
has
as
good
a
head
-
piece
as
the
best
.

But
,
she
's
mortal
high
and
passionate
—
powerful
high
and
passionate
;
and
what
with
having
notice
to
leave
,
and
having
others
put
above
her
,
she
do
n't
take
kindly
to
it
.
”


“
But
why
should
she
walk
,
shoeless
,
through
all
that
water
?
”
said
my
guardian
.


“
Why
,
indeed
,
sir
,
unless
it
is
to
cool
her
down
!
”
said
the
man
.


“
Or
unless
she
fancies
it
's
blood
,
”
said
the
woman
.

“
She
'd
as
soon
walk
through
that
as
anything
else
,
I
think
,
when
her
own
's
up
!
”


We
passed
not
far
from
the
House
,
a
few
minutes
afterwards
.

Peaceful
as
it
had
looked
when
we
first
saw
it
,
it
looked
even
more
so
now
,
with
a
diamond
spray
glittering
all
about
it
,
a
light
wind
blowing
,
the
birds
no
longer
hushed
but
singing
strongly
,
everything
refreshed
by
the
late
rain
,
and
the
little
carriage
shining
at
the
doorway
like
a
fairy
carriage
made
of
silver
.

Still
,
very
steadfastly
and
quietly
walking
towards
it
,
a
peaceful
figure
too
in
the
landscape
,
went
Mademoiselle
Hortense
,
shoeless
,
through
the
wet
grass
.


“
Nay
,
my
dears
,
”
he
would
remonstrate
;
and
when
I
saw
Caddy
's
thin
arm
about
his
fat
neck
as
he
said
it
,
I
would
be
melted
too
,
though
not
by
the
same
process
;
“
Nay
,
nay
!

I
have
promised
never
to
leave
ye
.

Be
dutiful
and
affectionate
towards
me
,
and
I
ask
no
other
return
.

Now
,
bless
ye
!

I
am
going
to
the
Park
.
”


He
would
take
the
air
there
,
presently
,
and
get
an
appetite
for
his
hotel
dinner
.

I
hope
I
do
old
Mr.
Turveydrop
no
wrong
;
but
I
never
saw
any
better
traits
in
him
than
these
I
faithfully
record
,
except
that
he
certainly
conceived
a
liking
for
Peepy
,
and
would
take
the
child
out
walking
with
great
pomp
—
always
,
on
those
occasions
,
sending
him
home
before
he
went
to
dinner
himself
,
and
occasionally
with
a
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
.

But
,
even
this
disinterestedness
was
attended
with
no
inconsiderable
cost
,
to
my
knowledge
;
for
before
Peepy
was
sufficiently
decorated
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
the
professor
of
Deportment
,
he
had
to
be
newly
dressed
,
at
the
expence
of
Caddy
and
her
husband
,
from
top
to
toe
.


Last
of
our
visitors
,
there
was
Mr.
Jellyby
.

Really
when
he
used
to
come
in
of
an
evening
,
and
ask
Caddy
in
his
meek
voice
how
she
was
,
and
then
sit
down
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
and
make
no
attempt
to
say
anything
more
,
I
liked
him
very
much
.

If
he
found
me
bustling
about
,
doing
any
little
thing
,
he
sometimes
half
took
his
coat
off
,
as
if
with
an
intention
of
helping
by
a
great
exertion
;
but
he
never
got
any
further
.

His
sole
occupation
was
to
sit
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
looking
hard
at
the
thoughtful
baby
;
and
I
could
not
quite
divest
my
mind
of
a
fancy
that
they
understood
one
another
.


I
have
not
counted
Mr.
Woodcourt
among
our
visitors
,
because
he
was
now
Caddy
's
regular
attendant
.

She
soon
began
to
improve
under
his
care
;
but
he
was
so
gentle
,
so
skilful
,
so
unwearying
in
the
pains
he
took
,
that
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
I
am
sure
.

I
saw
a
good
deal
of
Mr.
Woodcourt
during
this
time
,
though
not
so
much
as
might
be
supposed
;
for
,
knowing
Caddy
to
be
safe
in
his
hands
,
I
often
slipped
home
at
about
the
hours
when
he
was
expected
.

We
frequently
met
,
notwithstanding
.

I
was
quite
reconciled
to
myself
now
;
but
I
still
felt
glad
to
think
that
he
was
sorry
for
me
,
and
he
still
was
sorry
for
me
I
believed
.

He
helped
Mr.
Badger
in
his
professional
engagements
,
which
were
numerous
;
and
had
as
yet
no
settled
projects
for
the
future
.


The
old
man
darted
at
him
a
sudden
look
,
which
even
called
my
attention
from
Ada
,
who
,
startled
and
blushing
,
was
so
remarkably
beautiful
that
she
seemed
to
fix
the
wandering
attention
of
the
little
old
lady
herself
.

But
as
Ada
interposed
,
and
laughingly
said
she
could
only
feel
proud
of
such
genuine
admiration
,
Mr.
Krook
shrunk
into
his
former
self
as
suddenly
as
he
had
leaped
out
of
it
.


“
You
see
I
have
so
many
things
here
,
”
he
resumed
,
holding
up
the
lantern
,
“
of
so
many
kinds
,
and
all
,
as
the
neighbours
think
(
but
they
know
nothing
)
,
wasting
away
and
going
to
rack
and
ruin
,
that
that
's
why
they
have
given
me
and
my
place
a
christening
.

And
I
have
so
many
old
parchmentses
and
papers
in
my
stock
.

And
I
have
a
liking
for
rust
and
must
and
cobwebs
.

And
all
's
fish
that
comes
to
my
net
.

And
I
ca
n't
abear
to
part
with
anything
I
once
lay
hold
of
(
or
so
my
neighbours
think
,
but
what
do
they
know
?
)
or
to
alter
anything
,
or
to
have
any
sweeping
,
nor
scouring
,
nor
cleaning
,
nor
repairing
going
on
about
me
.

That
's
the
way
I
've
got
the
ill
name
of
Chancery
.

I
do
n't
mind
.

I
go
to
see
my
noble
and
learned
brother
pretty
well
every
day
,
when
he
sits
in
the
Inn
.

He
do
n't
notice
me
,
but
I
notice
him
.

There
's
no
great
odds
betwixt
us
.

We
both
grub
on
in
a
muddle
.

Hi
,
Lady
Jane
!
”


A
large
grey
cat
leaped
from
some
neighbouring
shelf
on
his
shoulder
,
and
startled
us
all
.


“
Hi
!

Shew
'em
how
you
scratch
.

Hi
!

Tear
,
my
lady
!
”
said
her
master
.


The
cat
leaped
down
,
and
ripped
at
a
bundle
of
rags
with
her
tigerish
claws
,
with
a
sound
that
it
set
my
teeth
on
edge
to
hear
.


“
She
'd
do
as
much
for
any
one
I
was
to
set
her
on
,
”
said
the
old
man
.

“
I
deal
in
cat
-
skins
among
other
general
matters
,
and
hers
was
offered
to
me
.

It
's
a
very
fine
skin
,
as
you
may
see
,
but
I
did
n't
have
it
stripped
off
!

That
war
n't
like
Chancery
practice
though
,
says
you
!
”


He
had
by
this
time
led
us
across
the
shop
,
and
now
opened
a
door
in
the
back
part
of
it
,
leading
to
the
house
-
entry
.

As
he
stood
with
his
hand
upon
the
lock
,
the
little
old
lady
graciously
observed
to
him
before
passing
out
:
